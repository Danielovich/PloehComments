		Now that Google Reader is closing down and a lot of my readers may want to migrate their <em>ploeh blog</em> subscription to another service, I think it's the right time for a quick post about ploeh blog's syndication feed addresses.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I <a href="/2013/03/03/moving-the-blog-to-jekyll">migrated my blog to Jekyll</a> I made it a priority to ensure a certain level of backwards compatibility. The permalinks for the old posts are still served, although they are now redirects. For that reason, I also left the old syndication feed addresses in place. Specifically, I left this old RSS feed address in place: <code>/SyndicationService.asmx/GetRss</code>. This feed address sort of works, but has issues.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are several problems with the 'legacy' feed address:
		<ul>
			<li>Due to the way Jekyll works, the address actually points to an index.html file. Since a Jekyll-powered site is a static site, I don't control the server, and thus I can't manipulate the HTTP headers for individual resources. HTML files are served with the "text/html" Content-Type, which doesn't fit the XML content. Some clients seem to dislike this.</li>
			<li>Google Reader has created some 'ghost' entries based on the feed. I wonder if it has anything to do with the faulty Content-Type.</li>
			<li>Other users have reported that their clients (e.g. Outlook) don't like the feed. Again, I suspect it's because of the faulty Content-Type. While I think those clients should follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postel%27s_law">Postel's law</a>, they apparently don't.</li>
			<li>The address looks very implementation-specific.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		However, ploeh blog has new, 'proper' syndication feed addresses, so if you're already in the process of migrating your subscriptions away from Google Reader, please take a moment to update your subscription. That 'legacy' RSS address may not stick around forever.
	</p>
	<p>
		The proper syndication feed addresses for ploeh blog are:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>ATOM:</strong> <a href="/atom.xml">/atom.xml</a></li>
			<li><strong>RSS:</strong> <a href="/rss.xml">/rss.xml</a></li>
		</ul>
		Both serve responses with the "text/xml" Content-Type.
