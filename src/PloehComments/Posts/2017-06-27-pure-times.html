		A couple of years ago, I published an article called <a href="/2014/12/17/good-times-with-f">Good times with F#</a>. Unfortunately, that article never lived up to my expectations. Not that I don't have a good time with F# (I do), but the article introduced an attempt to model execution durations of operations in a functional manner. The article introduced a <code>Timed&lt;'a&gt;</code> generic type that I had high hopes for.
	</p>
	<p>
		Later, I published a Pluralsight course called <a href="{{ site.production_url }}/type-driven-development-with-fsharp">Type-Driven Development with F#</a>, in which I used <code>Timed&lt;'a&gt;</code> to implement a <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/PollingConsumer.html">Polling Consumer</a>. It's a good course that teaches you how to let F#'s type system give you rapid feedback. You can read <a href="/2015/08/10/type-driven-development">a few articles</a> that highlight the important parts of the course.
	</p>
	<p>
		There's a problem with the implementation, though. It's not functional.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's nice F# code, but F# is this friendly, forgiving, multi-paradigmatic language that enables you to get real work done. If you want to do this using <a href="/2017/01/30/partial-application-is-dependency-injection">partial application as a replacement for Dependency Injection</a>, it'll let you. It is, however, <a href="/2017/01/30/partial-application-is-dependency-injection">not functional</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Consider, as an example, this function:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;(Timed&lt;TimeSpan&nbsp;list&gt;&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;bool)&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;(unit&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;Timed&lt;&#39;a&gt;)&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;Timed&lt;TimeSpan&nbsp;list&gt;</span>
<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;State</span>
<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">transitionFromNoMessage</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">shouldIdle</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">idle</span>&nbsp;nm&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">if</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">shouldIdle</span>&nbsp;nm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">then</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">idle</span>&nbsp;()&nbsp;|&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:teal;">Untimed</span>.<span style="color:navy;">withResult</span>&nbsp;nm.Result&nbsp;|&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">ReadyState</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">else</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">StoppedState</span>&nbsp;nm.Result</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The <code>idle</code> function has the type <code>unit -&gt; Timed&lt;'a&gt;</code>. This can't possibly be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure function</a>, since a deterministic function can't produce a value from nothing when it doesn't know the type of the value. (In F#, this is technically not true, since we could return null for all reference types, and 'zero' for all value types, but even so, it should be clear that we can't produce any <em>useful</em> return value in a deterministic manner.)
	</p>
	<p>
		The same argument applies, in weaker form, to the <code>shouldIdle</code> function. While it <em>is</em> possible to write more than one pure function with the type <code>Timed&lt;TimeSpan list&gt; -&gt; bool</code>, the <em>intent</em> is that it should look at the time statistics and the current time, and decide whether or not it's 'safe' to poll again. Getting the current time from the system clock is a non-deterministic operation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ever since I discovered that Dependency Injection is impossible in functional programming, I knew that I had to return to the Polling Consumer example and show how to implement it in a truly functional style. In order to be sure that I don't accidentally call an impure function from a 'pure' function, I'll first <a href="/2017/06/28/pure-times-in-haskell">rewrite the Polling Consumer in Haskell</a>, and afterwards <a href="/2017/07/04/pure-times-in-f">translate the Haskell code to F#</a>. When reading, you can skip the Haskell article and go directly to the F# article, or vice versa, if you like.
