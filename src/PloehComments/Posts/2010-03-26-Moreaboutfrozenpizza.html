<div id="post">
	<p>In my <a href="/2010/03/17/AutoFixtureFreeze">previous blog post</a>, I introduced <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a>'s Freeze feature, but the example didn't fully demonstrate the power of the concept. In this blog post, we will turn up the heat on the frozen pizza a notch.</p> <p>The following unit test exercises the BasketPresenter class, which is simply a wrapper around a Basket instance (we're doing a pizza online shop, if you were wondering). In true TDD style, I'll start with the unit test, but I'll post the BasketPresenter class later for reference.</p>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Exercise system</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sut.Add(pizza);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Verify outcome</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Teardown</span>
}</pre>
</p>
<p>The interesting thing in the above unit test is that we Freeze a Basket instance in the fixture. We do this because we know that the BasketPresenter <em>somehow</em> wraps a Basket instance, but we trust the Fixture class to figure it out for us. By telling the fixture instance to Freeze the Basket we know that it will reuse the same Basket instance throughout the entire test case. That includes the call to CreateAnonymous&lt;BasketPresenter&gt;.</p>
<p>This means that we can use the frozen basket instance in the Verify call because we know that the same instance will have been reused by the fixture, and thus wrapped by the <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/SUT.html">SUT</a>.</p>
<p>When you stop to think about this on a more theoretical level, it fortunately makes a lot of sense. AutoFixture's terminology is based upon the excellent book <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/">xUnit Test Patterns</a>, and a Fixture instance pretty much corresponds to the concept of a <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/test%20fixture%20-%20xUnit.html">Fixture</a>. This means that freezing an instance simply means that a particular instance is constant throughout that particular fixture. Every time we ask for an instance of that class, we get back the same frozen instance.</p>
<p>In DI Container terminology, we just changed the Basket type's lifetime behavior from Transient to Singleton.</p>
<p>For reference, here's the BasketPresenter class we're testing:</p>
<p>
	<pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: blue">public</span> <span style="color: blue">class</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">BasketPresenter</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">private</span> <span style="color: blue">readonly</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">Basket</span> basket;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">private</span> <span style="color: blue">readonly</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">IPizzaMap</span> map;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">public</span> BasketPresenter(<span style="color: #2b91af">Basket</span> basket, <span style="color: #2b91af">IPizzaMap</span> map)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">if</span> (basket == <span style="color: blue">null</span>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">throw</span> <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">ArgumentNullException</span>(<span style="color: #a31515">"basket"</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">if</span> (map == <span style="color: blue">null</span>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">throw</span> <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">ArgumentNullException</span>(<span style="color: #a31515">"map"</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">this</span>.basket = basket;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">this</span>.map = map;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">public</span> <span style="color: blue">void</span> Add(<span style="color: #2b91af">PizzaPresenter</span> presenter)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">this</span>.map.Pipe(presenter, <span style="color: blue">this</span>.basket.Add);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
}</pre>
</p>
<p>If you are wondering about why this is interesting at all, and why we don't just pass in a Basket through the BasketPresenter's constructor, it's because we are using AutoFixture as a <a href="/2009/02/13/SUTFactory">SUT Factory</a>. We want to be able to refactor BasketPresenter (and in this case particularly its constructor) without breaking a lot of existing tests. The level of indirection provided by AutoFixture gives us just that ability because we never directly invoke the constructor.</p>

	<div class="comment-content">Interesting, interesting!<br>
It's not clear from the example how using AutoFixture for DI keeps our tests testing object behavior better than setting up dependencies through the constructor or setters.  I think it will suffer the same problems as we're examining private data.  It has one benefit in that our public APIs remain pristine from adding in special-ctors/Setters for DI.<br>
  <br>
But hey, I'm going to play with this and see what happens.  Thanks for the code sample!</div>

	<div class="comment-content">One of the biggest complaints that architects have about TDD is allowing developers to redesign classes to allow for dependency injection.  Even without strong change controls from top down, it would be convenient to be able to do DI without having to design for DI.  (These cases come up with those doing Test Last rather than Test First/TDD.)  Unfortunately this tool chain doesn't help this problem.  Power Mock (Java: http://java.dzone.com/articles/using-powermock-mock) reprograms the class loader so this can be done without designing for DI. Perhaps a later release of this tool could as well.  As of now, if I have to redesigning for DI[1], I don't need these other things as Moq already gives me this value.<br>
<br>
Am I missing something?<br>
