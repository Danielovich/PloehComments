    Not only can the F# type system help you catch basic errors in your code, but it can also help you by providing rapid feedback, and make suggestions on how to proceed. All you have to do is learn to listen.

    My new Pluralsight course, <a href="{{ site.production_url }}/type-driven-development-with-fsharp">Type-Driven Development with F#</a>, first walks you through three modules of exploration of a real problem, showing various ways you can take advantage of the type system in an <a href="{{ site.production_url }}/outside-in-tdd">Outside-in</a> fashion. As you can tell, it involves some celebration related to Finite State Machines:

    It then shows you how to stabilize the prototype using <a href="{{ site.production_url }}/property-based-testing-intro">Property-based Testing</a> with FsCheck.
