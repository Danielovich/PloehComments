	</p>
	<p>
		In January 2012 a customer asked for my help with software architecture. The CTO needed to formulate a strategy to deal with increasing demand for bring-your-own-device (BYOD) access to internal systems. Executives brought their iPhones and iPads to work and expected to be able to access and interact with custom-developed and bespoke internal line-of-business applications.
	</p>
	<p>
		Quite a few of these were running on the Microsoft stack, which was the reason Microsoft Denmark had recommended me.
	</p>
	<p>
		I had several meetings with the developers responsible for enabling BYOD. One guy, in particular, kept suggesting a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight">Silverlight</a> solution. I pointed out that Silverlight wouldn't run on Apple devices, but he wouldn't be dissuaded. He was <em>certain</em> that this was the correct solution, and I could tell that he became increasingly frustrated with me because he couldn't convince me.
	</p>
	<p>
		We'll return to this story later in this essay.

	</h3>
	<p>
		Sometimes people ask me questions like these:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How do I convince my manager to let me use <a href="https://fsharp.org">F#</a>?</li>
		<li>How do I convince my team mates to adopt test-driven development?</li>
		<li>How do I convince the entire team that code quality matters?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Sometimes I receive such questions via email. Sometimes people ask me at conferences or user groups.
	</p>
	<p>
		To quote <a href="https://ericlippert.com">Eric Lippert</a>: <a href="https://ericlippert.com/2012/12/17/performance-rant">Why are you even asking me?</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		To be fair, I do understand why people ask me, but I have few good answers.

	<p>
		I suppose people ask me because I've been writing about software improvement for decades. <a href="/">This blog</a> dates back to January 2009, and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ploeh">my previous MSDN blog</a> goes back to January 2006. These two resources alone contain more than 700 posts, the majority of which are about some kind of suggested improvement. Granted, there's also <a href="/2013/02/04/BewareofProductivityTools">the occasional rant</a>, by I think it's fair to say that my main motivation for writing is to share with readers what I think is right and good.
	</p>
	<p>
		I do write a lot about potential improvements to software development.
	</p>
	<p>
		As most readers have discovered, <a href="/dippp">my book about Dependency Injection</a> (with <a href="https://blogs.cuttingedge.it/steven/about/">Steven van Deursen</a>) is more than just a manual to a few Dependency Injection Containers, and my new book <a href="/code-that-fits-in-your-head">Code That Fits in Your Head</a> is full of suggested improvements.
	</p>
	<p>
		Add to that <a href="/pluralsight-courses">my Pluralsight courses</a>, <a href="https://cleancoders.com/videos/humane-code-real">my Clean Coders videos</a>, and <a href="/schedule">my conference talks</a>, and there's a clear pattern to most of my content.
	</p>
	<h3 id="b7902ef70c88416886f79138d5e4ee2a">

	<p>
		In <a href="http://amzn.to/18sHRmt">The Tipping Point</a> Malcolm Gladwell presents a model for information dissemination, containing three types of people required for an idea to take hold: Connectors, mavens, and salesmen.
	</p>
	<p>
		In that model, a <em>maven</em> is an 'information specialist' - someone who accumulates knowledge and shares it with others. If I resemble any of these three types of people, I'm a maven. I like learning and discovering new ways of doing things, and obviously I like sharing that information. I wouldn't have blogged consistently for sixteen years if I didn't <a href="/2021/03/22/the-dispassionate-developer">feel compelled</a> to do so.
	</p>
	<p>
		My role, as I see it, is to find and discover better ways of writing software. Much of what I write about is something that I've picked up somewhere else, but I try to present it in my own way, and I'm diligent about citing sources.
	</p>
	<p>
		When people ask me concrete questions, like <em>how do I refactor this piece of code?</em> or <em>how do write this in a more functional style?</em>, I present an answer (if I can).
	</p>
	<p>
		The suggestions I make are just that: It's a buffet of possible solutions to certain problems. If you encounter one of my articles and find the proposed technique useful, then that makes me happy and proud.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice the order of events: Someone has a problem, finds my content, and decides that it looks like a solution. Perhaps (s)he remembers my name. Perhaps (s)he feels that I helped solve a problem.
	</p>
	<p>
		Audience members that come to my conference talks, or readers who buy my books, may not have a concrete problem to solve, but they still voluntarily seeks me out - perhaps because of previous exposure to my content.
	</p>
	<p>
		To reiterate:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You have a problem (concrete or vague)</li>
		<li>Perhaps you come across my content</li>
		<li>Perhaps you find it useful</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Perhaps you think that I convinced you that 'my way' is best. I didn't. You were already looking for a solution. You were ready for a change. You were open.

		Salesman <a href="#332746ebf9b249118eaf61d8a52cb2ec" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		When you ask me about how to convince your manager, or your team mates, you're no longer asking me a technical question. Now you're asking about <a href="https://amzn.to/32xc9X5">how to win friends and influence people</a>. You don't need a maven for that; you need a <em>salesman</em>. That's not me.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've had some success applying changes to software organisations, but in all cases, the reason I was there in the first place was because the organisation itself (or members thereof) had asked me to come and help them. When people <em>want</em> your help changing things, convincing them to try something new isn't a hard sell.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I consult development teams, I'm not there to sell them new processes; I'm there to help them use appropriate solutions at opportune moments.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm not a salesman. Just because I convinced <em>you</em> that, say, property-based testing is a good idea doesn't mean I can convince anyone else. Keep in mind that I probably convinced you because you were ready for a change.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your manager or your team mates may not be.
	</p>
	<h3 id="2ce7188e30d64d318293fa17bd6da8dc">

	</h3>
	<p>
		While I'm no salesman, I've managed to turn people around from time to time. The best strategy, I've found, is to wait for an opportunity.
	</p>
	<p>
		As long as everything is going well, people aren't ready to change.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			"Only a crisis - actual or perceived - produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable"
		</p>
		<footer><a href="https://amzn.to/3BsIqLG">Milton Friedman</a></footer>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		If you have solutions at the ready, you may be able to convince your manager or your colleagues to try something new if a crisis occurs. Don't gloat - just present your suggestion: <em>What if we did this instead?</em>

	<p>
		Indeed, I'm not a salesman, and while I can't tell you how to <em>sell</em> an idea to an unwilling audience, I <em>can</em> tell you how you can weaken your position: Make it all about you.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice how questions like the above are often phrased: <em>my manager will not let me...</em> or <em>how do I convince my colleagues?</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1313490263">I actually didn't much like <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em></a>, but it does present the insight that in order to sway people, you have to consider what's in it for them.
	</p>
	<p>
		I had to be explicitly told this before I learned that lesson.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the second half of the 2000s I was attached to a software development project at a large Danish company. After a code review, I realised that the architecture of the code was <em>all wrong!</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to make the project manager aware of the issue, I wrote an eight-page internal 'white paper' and emailed it to the project manager (let's call him Henk).
	</p>
	<p>
		Nothing happened. No one addressed the problem.
	</p>
	<p>
		A few weeks later, I had a scheduled one-on-one meeting with my own manager in Microsoft, and when asked if I had any issues, I started to complain about this problem I'd identified.
	</p>
	<p>
		My manager looked at me for a moment and asked me: <em>How do you think receiving that email made Henk feel?</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		It had never crossed my mind to think about that. It was <em>my</em> problem! <em>I</em> discovered it! I viewed myself as a great programmer and architect because I had perceived such a complex issue and was able to describe it clearly. It was all about me, me, me.
	</p>
	<p>
		When we programmers ask how to convince our managers to 'let us' use TDD, or FP, or some other 'cool' practice, we're still focused on <em>us</em>. What's in it for the manager?
	</p>
	<p>
		When we talk about code quality and lack thereof, 'ugly code', refactoring, and other such language, a non-coding manager is likely to see us as primadonnas out of touch with reality: <em>We have features to ship, but the programmers only care about making the code 'pretty'.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		I offer no silver bullet to convince other people that certain techniques are superior, but do consider introducing suggestions by describing the benefits they bring: <em>Wouldn't it be cool if we could decrease our testing phase from three weeks to three days?</em>, <em>Wouldn't it be nice if we could deploy every week?</em>, <em>Wouldn't it be nice if we could decrease the number of errors our users encounter?</em>
	</p>

		You could be wrong <a href="#b98c57c52d06414d8d74d40cfea69056" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Have you ever felt frustrated that you couldn't convince other people to do it your way, despite <em>knowing</em> that you were right?
	</p>
	<p>
		Recall the developer from the introduction, the one who kept insisting that Silverlight was the right solution to the organisation's BYOD problem. He was clearly convinced that he had the solution, and he was frustrated that I kept rejecting it.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may scoff at such obvious ignorance of facts, but he had clearly drunk the Microsoft Kool-Aid. I could tell, because I'd been there myself. When you're a young programmer, you may easily buy into a compelling narrative. Microsoft evangelists were quite good at their game back then, as I suppose their Apple and Linux counterparts were and are. As an inexperienced developer, you can easily be convinced that a particular technology will solve all problems.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you're young and inexperienced, you can easily feel that you're absolutely right and still be unequivocally wrong.
	</p>
	<p>
		Consider this the next time you push your agenda. Perhaps your manager and colleagues reject your ideas because they're actually bad. A bit of metacognition is often appropriate.
	</p>

	<p>
		How do you convince your manager or team mates to do things better?
	</p>
	<p>
		I don't know; I'm not a salesman, but in this essay, I've nonetheless tried to reflect on the question. I think it helps to consider what the other party gains from accepting a change, but I also think it's a waiting game. You have to be patient.
	</p>
	<p>
		As an economist, I could also say much about incentives, but this essay is already long enough as it is. Still, when you consider how your counterparts react to your suggestions, reflect on how they are incentivised.
	</p>
	<p>
		Even if you do everything right, make the best suggestions at the most opportune times, you may find yourself in a situation systemically rigged against doing the right thing. Ultimately, as <a href="https://martinfowler.com">Martin Fowler</a> quipped, <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?ChangeYourOrganization">either change your organisation, or change your organisation</a>.
