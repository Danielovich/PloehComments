<div id="post">
	<p>
    Since <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a> <a href="/2009/07/01/AutoFixtureAsTestDataBuilder">is a Test Data Builder</a>, one of its most important tasks is to build up graphs of fully populated, yet semantically correct, strongly typed objects. As such, its default behavior is to assign a value to every writable property in the object graph.
  </p>
  <p>
    While this is sometimes the desired behavior, at other times it is not.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is particularly the case when you want to test that a newly created object has a property of a particular value. When you want to test the default value of a writable property, AutoFixture's AutoProperty feature is very much in the way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's consider as an example a piece of software that deals with vehicle registration. By default, a vehicle should have four wheels, since this is the most common occurrence. Although I always practice TDD, I'll start by showing you the Vehicle class to illustrate what I mean.
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre><span style="color: blue">public</span> <span style="color: blue">class</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">Vehicle</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">public</span> Vehicle()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">this</span>.Wheels = 4;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">public</span> <span style="color: blue">int</span> Wheels { <span style="color: blue">get</span>; <span style="color: blue">set</span>; }
}</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Here's a test that ensures that the default number of wheels is <em>4</em>  -  or does it?
  </p>
  <p>
    In fact the assertion fails because the actual value is <em>1</em>, not <em>4</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre>[<span style="color: #2b91af">TestMethod</span>]
<span style="color: blue">public</span> <span style="color: blue">void</span> AnonymousVehicleHasWheelsAssignedByFixture()
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Fixture setup</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">var</span> fixture = <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">Fixture</span>();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">var</span> sut = fixture.CreateAnonymous&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">Vehicle</span>&gt;();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Exercise system</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">var</span> result = sut.Wheels;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Verify outcome</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: #2b91af">Assert</span>.AreEqual&lt;<span style="color: blue">int</span>&gt;(4, result, <span style="color: #a31515">"Wheels"</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Teardown</span>
}</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Why does the test fail when the value of Wheels is set to <em>4</em> in the constructor? It fails because AutoFixture is designed to create <em>populated</em> test data, so it assigns a value to every writable property. Wheels is a writable property, so AutoFixture assigns an integer value to it using its <a href="/2009/04/03/CreatingNumbersWithAutoFixture">default algorithm for creating anonymous numbers</a>. Since no other numbers are being created during this test, the number assigned to Wheels is <em>1</em>. This is AutoFixture's AutoProperties feature in effect.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you want to test constructor logic, or otherwise wish to disable the AutoProperties feature, you can use a <a href="/2009/05/26/TheAutoFixtureBuilder">customized Builder</a> with the OmitAutoProperties method:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre>[<span style="color: #2b91af">TestMethod</span>]
<span style="color: blue">public</span> <span style="color: blue">void</span> VehicleWithoutAutoPropertiesWillHaveFourWheels()
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Fixture setup</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">var</span> fixture = <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">Fixture</span>();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">var</span> sut = fixture.Build&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">Vehicle</span>&gt;()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .OmitAutoProperties()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .CreateAnonymous();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Exercise system</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">var</span> result = sut.Wheels;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Verify outcome</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: #2b91af">Assert</span>.AreEqual&lt;<span style="color: blue">int</span>&gt;(4, result, <span style="color: #a31515">"Wheels"</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Teardown</span>
}</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    The OmitAutoProperties method instructs AutoFixture to skip assigning automatic Anonymous Values to all writable properties in the object graph. Any properties specifically assigned by the <a href="/2009/06/01/SettingPropertyValuesWhileBuildingAnonymousVariablesWithAutoFixture">With method</a> will still be assigned.
  </p>
  <p>
    The test using OmitAutoProperties succeeds.
