		Functional programming has a reputation for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumblerules">abstruse nomenclature</a>:
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				"Functional programmer: (noun) One who names variables "x", names functions "f", and names code patterns "zygohistomorphic prepromorphism""
			</p>
			<footer><cite><a href="https://twitter.com/jamesiry/status/598547781515485184">James Iry</a></cite></footer>
		</blockquote>
		I've already discussed <a href="/2015/08/17/when-x-y-and-z-are-great-variable-names">when x, y, and z are great variable names</a>, and I don't intend to say more about that sort of naming here. (And to be clear, <a href="https://twitter.com/kmett/status/1144981306654318594">zygohistomorphic prepromorphisms are a joke</a>.)
	</p>
	<p>
		What I <em>would</em> like to talk about is the contrast to the impenetrable jargon of functional programming: the crystal-clear vocabulary of object-oriented design. Particularly, I'd like to talk about <em>polymorphism</em>.
	</p>

		Etymology <a href="#5bf4938cae564d3984e2a77b8f6a017e" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)">Wikipedia puts it</a> (retrieved 2021-06-04), <em>polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types</em>. This doesn't quite fit with the actual meaning of the word, though.
	</p>
	<p>
		The word <em>polymorphism</em> is derived from Greek. <em>Poly</em> means <em>many</em>, and <em>morphism</em> stems from <em>μορφή</em> (<em>morphḗ</em>), which means <em>shape</em>. Putting all of this together, <em>polymorphism</em> means <em>many-shape</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		How does that fit with the idea of having a single interface? Not very well, I think.
	</p>
	<h3 id="21df55548c334577bcde7bf988a73ae6">
		A matter of perspective? <a href="#21df55548c334577bcde7bf988a73ae6" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		I suppose that if you view the idea of object-oriented polymorphism from the implementer's perspective, talking about many shapes makes marginal sense. Consider, for example, two classes from <a href="/2021/05/24/tennis-kata-using-the-state-pattern">a recent article</a>. Imagine, for example, that we replace every character in the <code>Advantage</code> code with an <code>x</code>:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxxx x xxxxxx
x
    xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx
    x
        xxxxxx x xxxxxxx
    x
 
    xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx x xxxx xxxx x
 
    xxxxxx xxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxx
    x
        xx xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxx
            xxxxxxxxxx x xxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
        xxxx
            xxxxxxxxxx x xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    x
x</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This trick of replacing all characters with <code>x</code> to see the shape of code is one I picked up from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevlin_Henney">Kevlin Henney</a>. Try to do the same with the <code>Deuce</code> struct from the same article:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx x xxxxxx
x
    xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx x xxx xxxxxxxx
 
    xxxxxx xxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxx xxxxx
    x
        xxxxxxxxxx x xxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    x
x</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Clearly, these two classes have different shapes.
	</p>
	<p>
		You could argue that all classes have different shapes, but what unites <code>Advantage</code> with <code>Deuce</code> (and three other classes) is that they implement a common interface called <code>IScore</code>. In a sense you can view an <code>IScore</code> object as an object that can have multiple shapes; i.e. a <em>polymorphism</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		While there's some soundness to this view, as terminology goes, the most important part is only implicitly understood. Yes, all objects have different shapes (<em>poly-morphic</em>), but in order to be a polymorphism, they must <em>present as one</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In practice, most of us understand what the other means if one of us says <em>polymorphism</em>, but this is only because we've learned what the word means in the context of object-oriented programming. It's not because the word itself is particularly communicative, even if you pick up the Greek roots.
	</p>

		Common interface <a href="#fe0c4a7d14284b10b243c7fa6751aa3d" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		The above outline doesn't present how I usually think about polymorphism. I've deliberately tried to steelman it.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I think of polymorphism, I usually focus on what two or more classes may have in common. Instead of replacing every character with an <code>x</code>, try instead to reduce the <code>Advantage</code> and <code>Deuce</code> structs to their public interfaces. First, <code>Advantage</code>:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">struct</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Advantage</span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;IScore
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Advantage</span>(Player&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">player</span>)
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;Player&nbsp;Player&nbsp;{&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">get</span>;&nbsp;}
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">void</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">BallTo</span>(Player&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">winner</span>,&nbsp;Game&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">game</span>)
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Now do the same with <code>Deuce</code>:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">struct</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Deuce</span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;IScore
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">readonly</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">static</span>&nbsp;IScore&nbsp;Instance
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">void</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">BallTo</span>(Player&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">winner</span>,&nbsp;Game&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">game</span>)
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		These two APIs are clearly different, yet they have something in common: the <code>BallTo</code> method. In fact, you can draw a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram">Venn diagram</a> of the public members of all five <code>IScore</code> classes:
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="/content/binary/venn-diagram-of-score-classes.png" alt="Venn diagram of the members of five classes.">
	</p>
	<p>
		Incidentally, three of the five classes (<code>Forty</code>, <code>Advantage</code>, and <code>CompletedGame</code>) also share a <code>Player</code> property, but all five share the <code>BallTo</code> method. Singling out that method yields the <code>IScore</code> interface:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">interface</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IScore</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">void</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">BallTo</span>(Player&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">winner</span>,&nbsp;Game&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">game</span>);
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Such a (statically-typed) common API is what I usually think of when I think of polymorphism. It's the <em>shape</em> that all five classes have in common. When viewed through the lens of the <code>IScore</code> interface, all five classes <em>have the same form!</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		The term <em>polymorphism</em> (<em>many shapes</em>) makes little sense in this light. Really, it ought to have been called <em>isomorphism</em> (<em>equal shape</em>), but unfortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism">that word already means something else</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sometimes, when you discover that the Greek word for a term is already taken, you can use Latin instead. Let's see, what would <em>one shape</em> be in Latin? <em>Uniform?</em> Yeah, that's also taken.
	</p>
	<p>
		Okay, I'm cheating by deliberately picking words that are already taken. Perhaps a better option might be <em>idiomorphism</em>, from Greek, <em>ἴδιος</em> (<em>idios</em>, “own, personal, distinct”).
	</p>

		Opacity <a href="#1bee363b4c554063933820905bee76c0" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		The point of all of this really isn't to harp on <em>polymorphism</em> in particular. This term is well understood in our industry, so there's no pragmatic reason to change it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Rather, I wish to point out the following:
		<ul>
			<li>Object-oriented design also includes Greek terms</li>
			<li>Even if you can decipher a Greek term, the name may not be helpful</li>
			<li>In fact, the name may be outright misleading</li>
		</ul>
		Ultimately, learning any jargon involves learning how particular words - even <em>normal</em> words - are understood in a particular context (what in <a href="http://amzn.to/WBCwx7">DDD</a> may be know as a <em>bounded context</em>). For example, the word <em>capital</em> means something completely different in architecture and finance.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is true also in programming. Without a context, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism">polymorphism can mean many things</a>. In biology, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)">it means the occurrence of two or more clearly different forms within a species</a>, for example light and black <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar">jaguars</a> (the animal, not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_Cars">the car</a> - another example that a word belongs in a context).
	</p>
	<p>
		This type of polymorphism in biology reminds me more of <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/RoleInterface.html">role interfaces</a>, where a single class can implement several interfaces, but perhaps that's just me.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ultimately, industry terminology is opaque until you learn it. Some words may be easier to learn than others, but looks can be deceiving. <em>Inheritance</em> may sound straightforward, but in object-oriented design, inheritance doesn't entail the death of someone else. Additionally, in programming languages with single inheritance, descendants can only inherit once. As a metaphor, <em>inheritance</em> is mediocre at best.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another friendly-sounding piece of terminology is <em>encapsulation</em> - despite the fact that it's essentially Latin, just warped by two millennia of slight linguistic drift. Even so, this most fundamental concept of object-oriented design <a href="/encapsulation-and-solid">is also the most misunderstood</a>. The word itself doesn't much help communicating the concept.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, I wish to remind my English-speaking readers that not all programmers have English as their native language. For many programmers, words like <em>class</em>, <em>object</em>, or <em>encapsulation</em> may be words that they only know via programming. These could be words that have no prior, intrinsic meaning to a speaker of Hungarian or Japanese.

	</h3>
	<p>
		Is functional programming terminology harder than object-oriented jargon? I don't think so.
	</p>
	<p>
		A nice little word like <em>monoid</em>, for example, is <a href="https://cleancoders.com/episode/humane-code-real-episode-2">Greek for <em>one-like</em></a>. Again, it's not self-explanatory, but once <a href="/2017/10/06/monoids">the concept of a monoid</a> is explained, it makes sense: it's an abstraction that enables you to treat many things as though they are a single thing (with possible loss of fidelity, though). As names go, I find this more accurate than <em>polymorphism</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Granted, there's more Greek in functional programming than in object-oriented design, but (Latin) English is still present: <em>recursion</em>, <em>fold</em>, and <em>traversal</em> are common terms.
	</p>
	<p>
		And then there's the occasional nonsense word, like <a href="/2018/03/22/functors">functor</a>. Despite some of digging, <a href="https://cleancoders.com/episode/humane-code-real-episode-5">I've only managed to learn that <em>functor</em> is a compaction of <em>function</em> and <em>factor</em></a> - that is, a <em>function factor</em>, but what does that tell you?
	</p>
	<p>
		In many ways, I prefer nonsense words like <em>functor</em>, because at least, they aren't misleading. When you learn that word, you have no preconception that you think you already know what it means. <a href="https://michaelfeathers.silvrback.com/a-book-of-form">Michael Feathers is experimenting with a similar idea, but in another context</a>, inventing words like <em>exot</em>, <em>lavin</em>, <em>endot</em>, <em>parzo</em>, <em>duon</em>, and <em>tojon</em>.

	</h3>
	<p>
		It's easy to dismiss the alien as incomprehensible. This often happens in programming. <a href="/2015/08/03/idiomatic-or-idiosyncratic">New ideas are dismissed as <em>non-idiomatic</em></a>. Alternative paradigms like functional programming are rejected because some words aren't immediately forthcoming.
	</p>
	<p>
		This, to me, says more about the person spurning new knowledge than it says about the ideas themselves.
