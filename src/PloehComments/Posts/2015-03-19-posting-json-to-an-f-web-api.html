    It seems that many people have problems with accepting JSON as input to a POST method when they attempt to implement an <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api">ASP.NET Web API</a> service in F#.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's really quite easy, with one weird trick :)
  </p>
  <p>
    You can follow my <a href="/2013/08/23/how-to-create-a-pure-f-aspnet-web-api-project">recipe for creating a pure F# Web API project</a> to get started. Then, you'll need to add a Data Transfer Record and a Controller to accept your data:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre>[&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">CLIMutable</span>&gt;]
<span style="color:blue;">type</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">MyData</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;{&nbsp;MyText&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">string</span>;&nbsp;MyNumber&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">int</span>&nbsp;}
 
<span style="color:blue;">type</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">MyController</span>()&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">inherit</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">ApiController</span>()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">member</span>&nbsp;this.Post(myData&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">MyData</span>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;this.Ok&nbsp;myData</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    That's quite easy; there's only one problem with this: the incoming <code>myData</code> value is always null.
  </p>

    The weird trick <a href="#0ceb82fe949f4690a3328d5fe5a86365" title="permalink">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    In addition to routes etc. you'll need to add this to your Web API configuration:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre>GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.Formatters.JsonFormatter.SerializerSettings.ContractResolver&nbsp;&lt;-
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newtonsoft.Json.Serialization.CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver()</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    You add this in your Application_Start method in your Global class, so you only have to add it once for your entire project.
  </p>
  <h3 id="03bb3b6ce3bd4289ac91ac595768bda7">
    The explanation <a href="#03bb3b6ce3bd4289ac91ac595768bda7" title="permalink">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Why does this work? Part of the reason is that when you add the [&lt;CLIMutable&gt;] attribute to your record, it causes the record type to be compiled with auto-generated internal mutable fields, and these are named by appending an @ character - in this case, the field names become <code>MyText@</code> and <code>MyNumber@</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apparently, the default JSON Contract Resolver (whatever that is) goes for those fields, even though they're internal, but the CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver doesn't. It goes for the properly named <code>MyText</code> and <code>MyNumber</code> writeable public properties that the compiler <em>also</em> generates.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the name implies, the CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver converts the names to camel case, so that the JSON properties become <code>myText</code> and <code>myNumber</code> instead, but I only find this appropriate anyway, since this is the convention for JSON.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can now start your service and make a POST request against it:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre>POST http://localhost:49378/my HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "myText": "ploeh",
    "myNumber": 42
}</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    This request creates this response:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{"myText":"ploeh","myNumber":42}</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    That's all there is to it.
  </p>
