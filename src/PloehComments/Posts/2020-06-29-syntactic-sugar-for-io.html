		This article is part of <a href="/2020/06/08/the-io-container">an article series about the IO container in C#</a>. In <a href="/2020/06/15/io-container-in-a-parallel-c-universe">the previous article</a> you saw a basic C# <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">hello world</a> program using <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code> to explicitly distinguish between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure functions</a> and impure actions. The code wasn't as pretty as you could hope for. In this article, you'll see how to improve the aesthetics a bit.
	</p>
	<p>
		The code isn't going to be perfect, but I think it'll be better.

		The <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code> container is an imitation of the <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> <code>IO</code> type. In Haskell, <code>IO</code> is a monad. This isn't a monad tutorial, and I hope that you're able to read the article without a deep understanding of monads. I only mention this because when you compose monadic values with each other, you'll sometimes have to write some 'noisy' code - even in Haskell. To alleviate that pain, Haskell offers syntactic sugar in the form of so-called <code>do</code> notation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Likewise, <a href="https://fsharp.org">F#</a> comes with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/computation-expressions">computation expressions</a>, which also gives you syntactic sugar over monads.
	</p>
	<p>
		C#, too, comes with syntactic sugar over <a href="/2022/03/28/monads">monads</a>. This is <em>query syntax</em>, but it's not as powerful as Haskell <code>do</code> notation or F# computation expressions. It's powerful enough, though, to enable you to improve the <code>Main</code> method from the previous article:

{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">from</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">in</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Console</span>.WriteLine(<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;What&#39;s&nbsp;your&nbsp;name?&quot;</span>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">from</span>&nbsp;name&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">in</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Console</span>.ReadLine()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">from</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;now&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">in</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Clock</span>.GetLocalTime()
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;greeting&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Greeter</span>.Greet(now,&nbsp;name)
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">from</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;res&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">in</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Console</span>.WriteLine(greeting)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">select</span>&nbsp;res;
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you use C# query syntax at all, you may think of it as exclusively the realm of object-relational mapping, but in fact it works for any monad. There's no data access going on here - just the interleaving of pure and impure code (in an <a href="/2020/03/02/impureim-sandwich">impureim sandwich</a>, even).

		For the above code to compile, you must add a pair of methods to the <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code> API. You can write them as extension methods if you like, but here I've written them as instance methods on <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you have multiple <code>from</code> keywords in the same query expression, you must supply a particular overload of <code>SelectMany</code>. This is an oddity of the implementation of the query syntax language feature in C#. You don't have to do anything similar to that in F# or Haskell.
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IO</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;&nbsp;SelectMany&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">U</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;(<span style="color:#2b91af;">Func</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IO</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">U</span>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;k,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Func</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">U</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;&nbsp;s)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;SelectMany(x&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;k(x).SelectMany(y&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IO</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;s(x,&nbsp;y))));
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Once you've implemented such overloads a couple of times, they're more tedious than challenging to write. They always follow the same template. First use <code>SelectMany</code> with <code>k</code>, and then <code>SelectMany</code> again with <code>s</code>. The only marginally stimulating part of the implementation is figuring out how to wrap the return value from <code>s</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		You're also going to need <code>Select</code> as shown in the article about <a href="/2020/06/22/the-io-functor">IO as a functor</a>.

		C#'s query syntax offers limited syntactic sugar over <a href="/2018/03/22/functors">functors</a> and monads. Compared with F# and Haskell, the syntax is odd and its functionality limited. The most galling lacuna is that you can't branch (e.g. use <code>if</code> or <code>switch</code>) inside query expressions.
	</p>
	<p>
		The point of these articles is (still) not to endorse this style of programming. While the code I show in this article series is working C# code that runs and passes its tests, I'm pretending that all impure actions in C# return <code>IO</code> results. To be clear, the <code>Console</code> class this code interacts with isn't <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.console">the Console class from the base class library</a>. It's a class that pretends to be such a class from a parallel universe.
	</p>
	<p>
		So far in these articles, you've seen how to compose impure actions with pure functions. What I haven't covered yet is the motivation for it all. We want the compiler to enforce the <a href="/2018/11/19/functional-architecture-a-definition">functional interaction law</a>: a pure function shouldn't be able to invoke an impure action. That's the topic for the next article.
