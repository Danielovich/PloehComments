    In <a href="/2015/08/10/type-driven-development">my article about Type Driven Development</a>, I demonstrated how to approach a problem in an iterative fashion, using the F# type system to do outside-in development. With the overall behaviour in place, there's still work to be done.
  </p>
  <p>
    From type inference of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function">higher-order functions'</a> arguments, we know that we still need to implement functions with these signatures:
    <ul>
      <li>ReadyData&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;bool</li>
      <li>unit&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;Timed&lt;MessageHandler option&gt;</li>
      <li>NoMessageData&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;bool</li>
      <li>unit&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;Timed&lt;'a&gt;</li>
    </ul>
    In this article, I'll show you how to implement the <code>NoMessageData&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;bool</code> function. If you want to see how to implement the other three functions, you can watch my <a href="{{ site.production_url }}/type-driven-development-with-fsharp">Type-Driven Development with F#</a> Pluralsight course.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>NoMessageData&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;bool</code> function is defined as the <code>shouldIdle</code> argument to the transitionFromNoMessage higher-order function. The purpose of the shouldIdle function is to determine whether there's enough remaining time to idle.
  </p>

  </h3>
  <p>
    Since we know the signature of the function, we can start by declaring it like this:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre><span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;shouldIdle&nbsp;(nm&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">NoMessageData</span>)&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">bool</span>&nbsp;=
</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Although it doesn't <em>have</em> to be called <em>shouldIdle</em>, in this case, I think the name is appropriate.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to determine if there's enough time left to idle, the function must know what time it is right now. Recall that, by design, PollingConsumer states are instantaneous, while transitions take time. The time a transition starts and stops is captured by a Timed&lt;'a&gt; value.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>nm</code> argument has the type <code>NoMessageData</code>, which is an alias for <code>Timed&lt;TimeSpan list&gt;</code>. The <code>Timed</code> part contains information about when the transition into the No message state started and stopped. Since being in a state has no duration, <code>nm.Stopped</code> represents the time when shouldIdle executes. That's part of the solution, so we can start typing:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre><span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;shouldIdle&nbsp;(nm&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">NoMessageData</span>)&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">bool</span>&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nm.Stopped</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    This doesn't yet compile, because <code>nm.Stopped</code> is a DateTimeOffset value, but the function is declared as returning bool.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we imagine that we add the idle duration to the current time, it should gives us the time it'd be when idling is done. That time should be less than the time the Polling Consumer must exit:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre><span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;shouldIdle&nbsp;(nm&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">NoMessageData</span>)&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">bool</span>&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nm.Stopped&nbsp;+&nbsp;idleDuration&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;stopBefore</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    This still doesn't compile because <code>idleDuration</code> and <code>stopBefore</code> are undefined, but this is easy to fix: promote them to arguments:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre><span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;shouldIdle&nbsp;idleDuration&nbsp;stopBefore&nbsp;(nm&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">NoMessageData</span>)&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">bool</span>&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nm.Stopped&nbsp;+&nbsp;idleDuration&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;stopBefore</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you paid attention to the <a href="/2015/08/10/type-driven-development">previous article</a>, you'll notice that this is exactly the same technique I used for the transitionFromNoMessage function. Apparently, we're not done with outside-in development yet.
  </p>

  </h3>
  <p>
    The function now compiles, and has the type <code>TimeSpan -&gt;&nbsp;DateTimeOffset -&gt;&nbsp;NoMessageData -&gt;&nbsp;bool</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once again, I've used the trick of promoting an undefined value to a function argument, and let type inference take care of the rest. This also works here. Since <code>nm.Stopped</code> is a DateTimeOffset value, and we're adding something to it with the <code>+</code> operator, <code>idleDuration</code> has to be of a type that supports adding to DateTimeOffset. The only thing you can add to DateTimeOffset is a TimeSpan, so <code>idleDuration</code> is inferred to be a TimeSpan value.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you add a TimeSpan value to a DateTimeOffset value, you get another DateTimeOffset value back, so the type of the expression <code>nm.Stopped + idleDuration</code> is DateTimeOffset. The entire return expression compares that DateTimeOffset value with the <code>&lt;</code> operator, which requires that both the left-hand and the right-hand expressions have the same type. Ergo must <code>stopBefore</code> also be a DateTimeOffset value.
  </p>
  <p>
    While we set out to implement a function with the type <code>NoMessageData&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;bool</code>, we eventually created a function with the type <code>TimeSpan -&gt;&nbsp;DateTimeOffset -&gt;&nbsp;NoMessageData -&gt;&nbsp;bool</code>, which isn't quite what we need.
  </p>

  </h3>
  <p>
    The extra arguments can be removed again with partial function application. <a href="/2015/08/12/type-driven-development-composition">When the Polling Consumer application starts, it can easily calculate when it ought to stop</a>:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre><span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;now&#39;&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">DateTimeOffset</span>.Now
<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;stopBefore&#39;&nbsp;=&nbsp;now&#39;&nbsp;+&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TimeSpan</span>.FromMinutes&nbsp;1.</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    This assumes that the Polling Consumer should run for a maximum of 1 minute.
  </p>
  <p>
    Likewise, we can create an idle duration value:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre><span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;idleDuration&#39;&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TimeSpan</span>.FromSeconds&nbsp;5.
</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Here, the value is hard-coded, but it could have gone in a configuration file instead, or be passed in as a command-line argument.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given these values, we can now partially apply the function:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre><span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;shouldIdle&#39;&nbsp;=&nbsp;shouldIdle&nbsp;idleDuration&#39;&nbsp;stopBefore&#39;
</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Since we're not supplying the third NoMessageData argument for the function, the return value of this partial application is a <em>new</em> function with the type <code>NoMessageData&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;bool</code> - exactly what we need.
  </p>
