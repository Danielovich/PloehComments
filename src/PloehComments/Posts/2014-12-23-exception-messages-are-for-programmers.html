  <p>
    Once in a while, I come across fellow programmers with uncertain understanding of the purpose of exception messages. In my experience, when it comes to writing exception messages, most developers approach the job with one of these mindsets:
    <ul>
      <li>Write the shortest possible exception message; if possible, ignore good grammar, punctuation, and proper spelling.</li>
      <li>Write lovingly crafted error messages for the end users.</li>
    </ul>
    Both approaches are wrong.
  </p>
  <h3 id="9479d0d1b0f4461ab94bc38eb0a6640b">
    Damn the torpedoes <a href="#9479d0d1b0f4461ab94bc38eb0a6640b" title="permalink">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    As far as I can tell, the most common approach to writing error messages is to get it over with as quickly as possible. Apparently, writing a good exception message is such tedious work that a developer can't possibly be bothered with it. Here are some examples:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre><span style="color:blue;">throw</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Exception</span>(<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;Unknown&nbsp;FaileType&quot;</span>);
</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    or:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre><span style="color:blue;">throw</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Exception</span>(<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;Unecpected&nbsp;workingDirectory&quot;</span>);
</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    These aren't particularly helpful. At the very least, is it too much to ask that they apply correct spelling and punctuation? Would it have been a horrible experience for the developer to write "Unknown FailureType.", or "Unexpected workingDirectory."?
  </p>
  <p>
    Even if spelling, grammar, and punctuation are corrected, these exception messages aren't particularly helpful to anyone. Fair enough that the FailureType or workingDirectory values were unknown or unexpected, but what <em>were</em> they, then?
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're seeing such exceptions while working with the code in your IDE, you may be able to attach a debugger and figure out what was the wrong value, but if you're looking at an error log from a production system, you'd really like to know the exact value that was unexpected.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, most developers apparently can't be bothered with supplying even such rudimentary information.

  <p>
    Developers who <em>do</em> care about exception messages often seem to have end users in mind. They may spell exception messages correctly, but shy away from providing technical information in the messages, because they are considering the user experience for the end users. They would argue that the "Unknown FailureType" shouldn't be included in the exception message, because it's too technical.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is, indeed, too technical for end users, but the misconception here is that exception messages should be exposed to end users at all. These developers seems to have a plan for exception handling, which essentially involves catching all exceptions at the boundary of the application, and simply show the exception message to the end user.
  </p>
  <p>
    That's unlikely to provide a good user experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    It should be clear that "Unknown FailureType." isn't particularly helpful to a fellow programmer, but it's even more useless to a non-technical end user. Thus, in an effort to shield end users from the technical failure modes of our program, we make exception messages useless to end users and fellow programmers alike.

    Security <a href="#005fcb618cf04c81a62bc6ed86c5a7ad" title="permalink">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Another argument I often encounter is one of security - in this case Information Disclosure. According to the argument, exception messages shouldn't include run-time values, because that may leak information about how the system works. Again, this argument seems to hinge on the implied usage of exception messages shown to end users.

  <p>
    Exception messages aren't for end users. End users don't speak your language. They don't speak 'Technical'. They may not even speak English. What if your target demographic is all Dutch? Are you going to write all of your exception messages in Dutch? Even if you do, what about exceptions thrown by your Base Class Library or third-party libraries? These are likely to be in English, so if you catch and display all exceptions, you may occasionally display an English message to your Dutch users.
  </p>
  <p>
    What if your application is designed for a Swiss audience? In which language are you going to write your exception messages? German? French? Italian? Romansh?
  </p>

    Conceptual coupling <a href="#f221aacfa1374fb9bf2dec6d64551323" title="permalink">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    All of the above arguments even implicitly assume that you're writing exception messages for a known system. What if you're writing a reusable library? If you're writing a reusable library, you don't know the context in which it's going to be used. If you don't know the context, then how can you write an appropriate message for an end user?
  </p>
  <p>
    It should be clear that when writing a reusable library, you're unlikely to know the <em>language</em> of the end user, but it's worse than that: you don't know <em>anything</em> about the end user. You don't even know if there's going to be an end user at all; your library may as well be running inside a batch job.
  </p>
  <p>
    The converse is true as well. Even if you aren't writing a reusable library, end user-targeted exception messages <em>increases the coupling</em> in the system, because exception messages would be coupled to a particular user interface. This sort of coupling doesn't occur in the type system, but is conceptual. Exactly because it's not tied to any type system, an automated tool can't detect it, so it's much harder to notice, and more insidious as a result.
  </p>
  <p>
    Exception messages are not for end users. Applications can catch known exception <em>types</em> and translate them to context-aware error messages, but this is a user interface concern - not a technical concern.

  </h3>
  <p>
    Now that you understand that exception messages shouldn't be aimed at end users, who's left? Your fellow programmers, including your future self. As I explain in <a href="{{ site.production_url }}/encapsulation-and-solid">my encapsulation course</a>, exception messages can be used as documentation of the system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine that you're using a new library that you don't yet know well. Which exception message would you, as a programmer, prefer to encounter?
    <blockquote>
      "Unecpected workingDirectory"
    </blockquote>
    or this:
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "You tried to provide a working directory string that doesn't represent a working directory. It's not your fault, because it wasn't possible to design the FileStore class in such a way that this is a statically typed pre-condition, but please supply a valid path to an existing directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The invalid value was: "fllobdedy"."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    How do those two messages make you feel?
  </p>
  <p>
    The first type of exception message often make me feel that I suck. The second is mostly an annoyance that my program doesn't work, followed by delight that the object I'm using makes it easy for me to <em>solve my problem</em>.
  </p>
  <p>    
    If you encounter the first exception message, you'll often need to attach a debugger to figure out what was wrong, or at least open the offending code to understand what made it fail. In the second example, the object you're using does its best to provide you with all the information you need in order to solve the problem.
  </p>

    Call to action <a href="#b667f38a68b54fdbbbfaa13e11dc8ee0" title="permalink">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Do write useful exception messages aimed at other developers. Use correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Try to phrase the message in a non-blaming way. Supply information about the context or the offending value. If possible, suggest how to resolve the error.
  </p>
  <p>
    It will take you an extra five minutes to write such an exception message, but will save your colleagues, your clients, and your future self hours of troubleshooting and debugging.

      <p>Exceptions with exceptionally great error messages is a pet peeve of mine, and I've always had the personal philosophy that exceptions should not be a slap in the face; they should be a step forward. Therefore, I usually follow the rule that exceptions must provide both a) details about the error (including, of course, the wrong value and information about the expected domain), and b) one or more suggestions for a way forward (which may have been done implicitly already by elaborating on the domain, but may sometimes require extra effort like e.g. <a href="https://github.com/rebus-org/Rebus/blob/master/src/Rebus/Transports/Encrypted/EncryptionAndCompressionConfigurationExtensions.cs#L129">helping with coming up with a proper value</a>).</p>
      <p>I have a question for you though, regarding exceptions: I usually introduce a special exception when I'm building software for clients: a <code>DomainException</code>! As you might have guessed, it's a special exception that is meant to be consumed by humanoids, i.e. the end user. This means that it is crafted to be displayed without a stack trace, providing all the necessary context through its <code>Message</code> alone. This is the exception that the domain model may throw from deep down, telling the user intimate details about a failed validation that could only be checked at that time and place.</p>
      <p>As far as I can see, there's two problems with my <code>DomainException</code>: 1) It's not that <a href="https://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/tips">exceptional</a> since it's used as a fallback validation that can be used when the UI is too lazy to provide the validation (or has higher prioritized work to do), and 2) I wouldn't know how to introduce a second language in my application with this approach.</p>
      <p>The 1st "problem" isn't really a problem in my book - I get that it's silly to use exceptions for control flow, but I bet there's no way you can provide a clearer and more succinct way of guarding the domain model's integrity AND provide an excellent error message at the same time than you can by throwing an appropriate <code>DomainException</code>.</p>
      <p>The 2nd problem <em>could</em> be a problem though - luckily, I haven't yet tried building something that didn't use either Danish or English as its only language, but I guess I could make the <code>DomainException</code> localizable somehow...</p>
      <p>I'm curious, though, as to how other people solve the problem of deep-domain validation, and now - since you wrote this blog post - I'm asking you: how do you do it? :)</p>

	  <p>I wholeheartedly agree with you, Mark. Users shouldn't see technical error messages and they really don't care about them. They just want it to work and when it doesn't, they want to feel sure that somebody is looking into it.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Exceptions and error handling are, obviously, tightly connected and <a href="http://softwarepassion.eu/error-handling-the-easy-way/">I have written about this</a>. Its a long piece, but the gist of it is that there are three general classes of errors:
		<ul>
			<li>Unrecoverable errors - the computers and the users involved cannot do anything about.</li>
			<li>Recoverable errors requiring user intervention - e.g. spelling mistakes.</li>
			<li>Recoverable errors not requiring user intervention - e.g. time outs, which can be automatically retried.</li>
		</ul>
	  </p>
	  <p>
		What <em>is</em> important for an exception is for it to contain enough information for the UI-layer (be it web, desktop, whatever), to ensure the user that somebody is actually on the go to solve the problem. It could be something as simple as a link to where the user
		can be updated about progress. This of course means that exceptions should be logged and meticulously followed up upon, which takes time and resources.		
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  This leads on to the general concept of application logging, which I have not written about, yet ;)
	  </p>
	  <p>To Mogens: I think your <code>DomainException</code> should not contain any text, per say, just the data. The text should then be stored
	  in resources, the same way as any other localizable text should be.

	  <p>I sympathize with Mogens. I, too, have found situations where an exception wants to be able to provide a

	  <p>
	  As for Mogens, I kinda agree with Torben. The <code>DomainException</code> may contain text or raw data, and let the 
	  top-level exception handler at your application handle the message format for you. It can decrease coupling as you can
	  handle the message to different UI (batch, web, desktop, mobile). It also provide more properly formatted text.

        Mogens, thank you for writing. I know that you have a passion for well-written exception messages; in fact, you are one of the many people who inspired me to make exception messages more and more helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
        How do I deal with 'deep' exceptions? First of all, I try hard to avoid them in the first place. One of the ways to do that is to validate input as close to the application boundary as possible, and transform it into something that properly protects its invariants; I recently wrote <a href="/2015/01/19/from-primitive-obsession-to-domain-modelling">an article with a simple example of doing that</a> (you may also want to read the comments, which contain a few gems).
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if you can eliminate many 'deep' exceptions, you can't get rid of all of them. Particularly if you integrate with legacy systems, it can be difficult to validate everything up front, because the 'rules' of the legacy system may not be clear or public. In such cases, I prefer to throw custom exceptions. In each place where I need to throw an exception, I create a new Exception class and throw that. This means that any client can catch that particular exception type, and convert it to a friendly user message. If you need to provide additional information to the user, the custom Exception class can have extra properties with the required information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically, if you start with the approach of validating input, and protecting invariants of objects, you aren't going to need a ton of custom Exception classes, so I find this approach manageable, although still not 'nice'.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution described by James Jensen above is one that I've never seen before, but it sounds like a good alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an overall comment, it's true that we shouldn't use exceptions for control flow, but unfortunately, most object-oriented languages give us no nice alternatives. However, in languages with Sum Types (Discriminated Unions in F#), there are <a href="http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/recipe-part2">much better options for error handling</a>. That's what I use when I write F# code, which is my preferred language these days.

        I agree with this post at a basic level. Starting out this is the right way to handle exceptions. The thing is, you haven't really addressed the problems this restriction leads on to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Internally caught exceptions are for the programmer to handle and write code for. You may want different types to indicate the handling. For example, I have a piece of code that has to communicate over an unreliable network connection. When this fails, it tends to be more efficient to catch to exception and make certain decisions about retrying than to have the error bounce all the way back up the chain of commands where all that will happen in most circumstances anyway is that a retry attempt will be made.
      </p>
      <p>
        What happens when the programmer doesn't catch the exception? Why can't it be for the user? What if there is something more you can do to help the user beyond "computer said no"? There might be a reason that meme exists. Something unexpected can happen in the code and IO, the user is one of those components. Why can't it be handled there or in another system the exception propagates to? This is a weird one if you think about it. For any other IO fault I can just throw an exception saying what is wrong but when it comes to the user, I can't use exceptions for this?
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that in any large multiple interface project that exceptions can and potentially should be for everyone. However I do not believe this should be ambiguous.
      </p>
      <p>
        I solve this by creating special "UserDoneBadExceptions" so to speak (not literally called that). A few other names and approaches come to mind such as safe exception and friendly exception (hi *wave*). I'll stick to safe exception from now on. Different languages or frameworks will influence which approach for this is best. Personally I've found myself having to monkey patch some nasty kludges for this.
      </p>
      <p>
         If something reaches the top level without being caught, then it will be forwarded to the next system if it is a safe exception otherwise the current exception will be consumed (such a to the log) and a safe exception will be sent. A safe exception is no different really to those special exceptions that help tell the programmer how to handle them or what to do (retry, fallback, log and ignore, abort, reopen, reconnect, clean up in a certain way, etc). I tend to describe exceptions that need to be converted as give up, complain to support, prey, retry, figure out a workaround, do what you want or shrug exceptions. Basically they're an ouch, the error has been logged, the developer *may* look at the logs and fix it at some date but if it's really important, workaround, go to support, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Establishing that it might be a good idea for an exception system to indicate action at every level raises the question of what to indicate for an exception exiting the system to another system. You always assume at some point it will reach a user so the default is typically that a safe exception triggered by any other exception should explain to the user that an error has occured, not much can be done, perhaps a link to support, definitely some means of linking to the error log (at least a timestamp) and in extreme cases the error log encrypted so they can copy and paste it to support.
      </p>
      <p>
      	There is a repeat ambiguity with safe exceptions because the receiving system may be able to handle the exception. In fact it may be handled both in how it deals with the user and through automation. It is common to extend safe exceptions so that they contain action for the user in the sense of providing them with feedback about what they can do as well as sufficient data for the system so that if it is capable it can take action. I've found the two most common cases for this is to either be able to provide auxilery updated data if the front end is out of date or to indicate a redirect (which can double as a refresh, be careful, very careful). A simple way to look at it is if you cared for using HTTP status codes then which codes and messages should you exceptions indicate the use of?
      </p>
      <p>
      	What this really comes down to is that you need to define separate domains for your exceptions. Are they internal or external? Are they some combination of both (if you are poking your own RPC service then it's technically internal external but really just internal, you can propagate it as-is)? The concept could be called intersystem exceptions. The benefit I find for this is better code reuse and generally less coded needed. I can use all of my permissions systems for RPC for anything with sometimes a thin layer of conversion for different output types and it works pretty well as a one size fits all. Whether my exceptions are poking out into AJAX, websocket XML RPC, JSON RPC, HTML full page load, etc in each case a thin layer of conversion, handling, etc manages it all.
      </p>
      <p>
      	With that it is important to make special safe exceptions reasonably abstract avoiding specifics unless specifics are needed or work better. It's something to think about. Should a login required safe exception simply be a redirect exception to the login page or should it be down to the system to interpret the error type/code and to then be self aware about where the login prompt should be and where to display it? I would personally opt for the latter in a lot of cases but it really depends on what systems you're deailing with. This approach wont be for everyone. Not that many projects become large enough to justify architecting a complex inter system exception system.
