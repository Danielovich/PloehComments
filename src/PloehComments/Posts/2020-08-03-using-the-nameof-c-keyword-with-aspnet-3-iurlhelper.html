		I recently spent a couple of hours yak-shaving, and despite much Googling couldn't find any help on the internet. I'm surprised that the following problem turned out to be so difficult to figure out, so it may just be that I'm ignorant or that my web search skills failed me that day. On the other hand, if this really is as difficult as I found it, perhaps this article can save some other poor soul an hour or two.

	</p>
	<p>
		I was developing a REST API and wanted to generate some links like these:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>{
  "links": [
    {
      "rel": "urn:reservations",
      "href": "http://localhost:53568/reservations"
    },
    {
      "rel": "urn:year",
      "href": "http://localhost:53568/calendar/2020"
    },
    {
      "rel": "urn:month",
      "href": "http://localhost:53568/calendar/2020/7"
    },
    {
      "rel": "urn:day",
      "href": "http://localhost:53568/calendar/2020/7/7"
    }
  ]
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Like previous incarnations of the framework, ASP.NET Core 3 has <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.urlhelperextensions.action">an API for generating links to a method on a Controller</a>. I just couldn't get it to work.
	</p>

	</h3>
	<p>
		I wanted to generate a URL like <code>http://localhost:53568/calendar/2020</code> in a refactoring-friendly way. While ASP.NET wants you to define HTTP resources as methods (<em>actions</em>) on <em>Controllers</em>, the various <code>Action</code> overloads want you to identify these actions and Controllers as strings. What happens if someone renames one of those methods or Controller classes?
	</p>
	<p>
		That's what the C# <code>nameof</code> keyword is for.
	</p>
	<p>
		I naively called the <code>Action</code> method like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;href&nbsp;=&nbsp;Url.Action(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">nameof</span>(<span style="color:#2b91af;">CalendarController</span>.Get),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">nameof</span>(<span style="color:#2b91af;">CalendarController</span>),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;{&nbsp;year&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">DateTime</span>.Now.Year&nbsp;},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Url.ActionContext.HttpContext.Request.Scheme,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Url.ActionContext.HttpContext.Request.Host.ToUriComponent());</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Looks good, doesn't it?
	</p>
	<p>
		I thought so, but it didn't work. In the time-honoured tradition of mainstream programming languages, the method just silently fails to return a value and instead returns null. That's not helpful. What might be the problem? No clue is provided. It just doesn't work.
	</p>
	<h3 id="3f7f01514e5a4c518ddd37226352970e">
		Strip off the suffix <a href="#3f7f01514e5a4c518ddd37226352970e" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		It turns out that the <code>Action</code> method expects the <code>controller</code> argument to <em>not</em> contain the <code>Controller</code> suffix. Not surprisingly, <code>nameof(CalendarController)</code> becomes the string <code>"CalendarController"</code>, which doesn't work.
	</p>
	<p>
		It took me some time to figure out that I was supposed to pass a string like <code>"Calendar"</code>. <em>That</em> works!
	</p>
	<p>
		As a first pass at the problem, then, I changed my code to this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;controllerName&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">nameof</span>(<span style="color:#2b91af;">CalendarController</span>);
<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;controller&nbsp;=&nbsp;controllerName.Remove(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controllerName.LastIndexOf(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;Controller&quot;</span>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">StringComparison</span>.Ordinal));
 
<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;href&nbsp;=&nbsp;Url.Action(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">nameof</span>(<span style="color:#2b91af;">CalendarController</span>.Get),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controller,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;{&nbsp;year&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">DateTime</span>.Now.Year&nbsp;},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Url.ActionContext.HttpContext.Request.Scheme,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Url.ActionContext.HttpContext.Request.Host.ToUriComponent());</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		That also works, and is more refactoring-friendly. You can rename both the Controller class and the method, and the link should still work.
	</p>

	</h3>
	<p>
		The <code>UrlHelperExtensions.Action</code> methods expect the <code>controller</code> to be the 'semantic' name of the Controller, if you will - not the actual class name. If you're calling it with values produced with the <code>nameof</code> keyword, you'll have to strip the <code>Controller</code> suffix away.
