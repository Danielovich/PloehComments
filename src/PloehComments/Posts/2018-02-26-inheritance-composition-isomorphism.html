	<p>
		This article is part of <a href="/2018/01/08/software-design-isomorphisms">a series of articles about software design isomorphisms</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Chapter 1 of <a href="http://amzn.to/XBYukB">Design Patterns</a> admonishes:
		<blockquote>
			Favor object composition over class inheritance
		</blockquote>
		People sometimes struggle with this, because they use inheritance as a means to achieve reuse. That's not necessary, because you can use object composition instead.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the <a href="/2018/02/19/abstract-class-isomorphism">previous article</a>, you learned that an abstract class can be refactored to a concrete class with injected dependencies.
	</p>
	<p>
		Did you notice that there was an edge case that I didn't cover?
	</p>
	<p>
		I didn't cover it because I think it deserves its own article. The case is when you want to reuse a base class' functionality in a derived class. How do you do that with Dependency Injection?
	</p>

	<p>
		Imagine a virtual method:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">virtual</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">OutVirt1</span>&nbsp;Virt1(<span style="color:#2b91af;">InVirt1</span>&nbsp;arg)
</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		In C#, a method is virtual when explicitly marked with the <code>virtual</code> keyword, whereas this is the default in Java. When you override a virtual method in a derived class, you can still invoke the parent class' implementation:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">override</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">OutVirt1</span>&nbsp;Virt1(<span style="color:#2b91af;">InVirt1</span>&nbsp;arg)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;Do&nbsp;stuff&nbsp;with&nbsp;this&nbsp;and&nbsp;arg</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;baseResult&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">base</span>.Virt1(arg);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;return&nbsp;an&nbsp;OutVirt1&nbsp;value</span>
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		When you override a virtual method, you can use the <code>base</code> keyword to invoke the parent implementation of the method that you're overriding. The enables you to reuse the base implementation, while at the same time adding new functionality.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you perform the refactoring to Dependency Injection shown in the previous article, you now have an interface:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">interface</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IVirt1</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">OutVirt1</span>&nbsp;Virt1(<span style="color:#2b91af;">InVirt1</span>&nbsp;arg);
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		as well as a default implementation. In the previous article, I showed an example where a single class implements several 'virtual member interfaces'. In order to make this particular example clearer, however, here you instead see a variation where the default implementation of <code>IVirt1</code> is in a class that only implements that interface:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">class</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">DefaultVirt1</span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IVirt1</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">OutVirt1</span>&nbsp;Virt1(<span style="color:#2b91af;">InVirt1</span>&nbsp;arg)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;Do&nbsp;stuff&nbsp;with&nbsp;this&nbsp;and&nbsp;arg;&nbsp;return&nbsp;an&nbsp;OutVirt1&nbsp;value.</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>DefaultVirt1.Virt1</code> corresponds to the original virtual method on the abstract class. How can you 'override' this default implementation, while still make use of it?
	</p>

	</h3>
	<p>
		You have a default implementation, and instead of replacing all of it, you want to somehow enhance it, but still use the 'base' implementation. Instead of inheritance, you can use composition:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">class</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">OverridingVirt1</span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IVirt1</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">private</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">readonly</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IVirt1</span>&nbsp;@base&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">DefaultVirt1</span>();
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">OutVirt1</span>&nbsp;Virt1(<span style="color:#2b91af;">InVirt1</span>&nbsp;arg)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;Do&nbsp;stuff&nbsp;with&nbsp;this&nbsp;and&nbsp;arg</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;baseResult&nbsp;=&nbsp;@base.Virt1(arg);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;return&nbsp;an&nbsp;OutVirt1&nbsp;value</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to drive home the similarity, I named the class field <code>@base</code>. I couldn't use <code>base</code> as a name, because that's a keyword in C#, but you can use the prefix <code>@</code> in order to use a keyword as a legal C# name. Notice that the body of <code>OverridingVirt1.Virt1</code> is almost identical to the above, inheritance-based overriding method.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a variation, you can inject <code>@base</code> via the constructor of <code>OverridingVirt1</code>, in which case you have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern">Decorator</a>.
	</p>

	</h3>
	<p>
		If you already have an interface with a 'default implementation', and you want to reuse the default implementation, then you can use object composition as shown above. At its core, it's reminiscent of the Decorator design pattern, but instead of receiving the inner object via its constructor, it creates the object itself. You can, however, also use a Decorator in order to achieve the same effect. This will make your code more flexible, but possibly also more error-prone, because you no longer have any guarantee what the 'base' is. This is where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov Substitution Principle</a> becomes important, but that's a digression.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you're using the previous <a href="/2018/02/19/abstract-class-isomorphism">abstract class isomorphism</a> to refactor to Dependency Injection, you can refactor any use of <code>base</code> to object composition as shown here.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is a special case of <em>Replace Inheritance with Delegation</em> from <a href="http://amzn.to/YPdQDf">Refactoring</a>, which also describes the inverse refactoring <em>Replace Delegation with Inheritance</em>, thereby making these two refactorings an isomorphism.

	<p>
		This article focuses on a particular issue that you may run into if you try to avoid the use of abstract classes. Many programmers use inheritance in order to achieve reuse, but this is in no way necessary. Favour composition over inheritance.
