    Soon after the release of my <a href="{{ site.production_url }}/unit-testing-with-fsharp">Unit Testing with F#</a> Pluralsight course, it gives me great pleasure to announce my new course, which is an <a href="{{ site.production_url }}/property-based-testing-intro">Introduction to Property-based Testing with F#</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this course, you'll get an introduction to the concept of Property-Based Testing, and see a comprehensive example that demonstrates how to incrementally implement a feature that otherwise would have been hard to address in an iterative fashion.
