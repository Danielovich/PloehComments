<div id="post">

    As <a href="/2009/03/24/HowAutoFixtureCreatesObjects">previously hinted</a>, <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a> creates primitive types like strings, numbers, etc. using special algorithms.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this post, I'll describe the <em>default</em> algorithm for strings. If you don't like this particular algorithm, you can replace it with your own.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you don't care about the created string at all, you can just create it like this:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre><span style="color: blue">string</span> anonymousText = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fixture.CreateAnonymous&lt;<span style="color: blue">string</span>&gt;();</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    The algorithm is simply to create a new Guid and convert it to a string, so that anonymousText will have a value like “f5cdf6b1-a473-410f-95f3-f427f7abb0c7”. Obviously, you don't know exactly which value will be returned, but that's the whole point of <a href="/2009/03/05/ConstrainedNon-Determinism">Constrained Non-Determinism</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I create string values as <a href="/2009/03/11/ExplicitExpectations">Explicit Expectations</a>, I prefer that the Assert failure message contains some sort of hint for me, so I can instead provide a hint to the CreateAnonymous method:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre><span style="color: blue">string</span> anonymousName = fixture.CreateAnonymous(<span style="color: #a31515">"Name"</span>);</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    This overload is still generic, but since I provide a string as input, type inferencing takes care of the rest.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is still going to create a Guid, but will now prepend the hint, giving a string like “Name30a35da1-d681-441b-9db3-77ff51728b58”.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, when my test fails, I'll get an error message equivalent to
  </p>
  <p>
    "Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:&lt;Namef2b1f55b-e9dc-4aac-a1ab-128dc80d3b71&gt;. Actual:&lt;ploeh&gt;. Boo hiss"
  </p>
  <p>
    which I find marginally more informative than if the hint hadn't been there.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a future post, I'll explain how you can replace this algorithm with something else.
