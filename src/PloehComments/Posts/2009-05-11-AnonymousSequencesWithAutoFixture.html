title: "Anonymous Sequences With AutoFixture"
---
{% include JB/setup %}

<div id="post">
	<p>
		When writing unit tests you often need to deal with sequences and collections, populating lists with anonymous data as part of setting up a <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/test%20fixture%20-%20xUnit.html">Fixture</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is easy to do with <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a>. While you can obviously create a simple loop and call CreateAnonymous from within the loop, AutoFixture provides some convenient methods for working with sequences.
	</p>
	<p>
		Equivalent to the CreateAnonymous method, the Fixture class also includes the CreateMany method that creates a sequence of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ploeh/archive/2008/11/17/anonymous-variables.aspx">anonymous variables</a>. <em>CreateManyAnonymous</em> might have been a more concise and consistent name for the method, but I felt that this was a bit too verbose.
	</p>
	<p>
		This will create an IEnumerable&lt;string&gt;:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: #2b91af">Fixture</span> fixture = <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">Fixture</span>();
<span style="color: blue">var</span> strings = fixture.CreateMany&lt;<span style="color: blue">string</span>&gt;();</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Obviously, you can create sequences of whatever type you want, as long as <a href="/2009/03/24/HowAutoFixtureCreatesObjects">AutoFixture can figure out how to create instances of the type</a>:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: blue">var</span> myInstances = fixture.CreateMany&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">MyClass</span>&gt;();</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Being able to create sequences of anonymous data is nice, but sometimes you need to add multiple anonymous items to an existing list (particularly if that list is a read-only property of your <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/SUT.html">SUT</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		To support that scenario, the Fixture class also has the AddManyTo method that can be used like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: blue">var</span> list = <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">List</span>&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">MyClass</span>&gt;();
fixture.AddManyTo(list);</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This simply creates many anonymous MyClass instances and adds them all to the list. Once more, <em>AddManyAnonymousTo</em> might have been a more precise name, but again I chose a less verbose alternative.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you want more control over how the instances are created, a more explicit overload of AddManyTo gives you that.
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: blue">var</span> list = <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">List</span>&lt;<span style="color: blue">int</span>&gt;();
<span style="color: blue">var</span> r = <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">Random</span>();
fixture.AddManyTo(list, () =&gt; r.Next());</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The above examples adds many random numbers to the list of integers, since the second parameters is a Func&lt;T&gt; used to create the instances.
	</p>
	<p>
		By default, these methods all create 3 anonymous variables when called, since <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ploeh/archive/2008/12/08/3-is-many.aspx">3 is a good equivalent for <em>many</em></a>. If you want a different number of instances to be created, you can modify the RepeatCount property.
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre style="margin: 0px">fixture.RepeatCount = 10;
<span style="color: blue">var</span> sequence = fixture.CreateMany&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">MyClass</span>&gt;();</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The above example will create an IEnumerable&lt;MyClass&gt; with 10 anonymous MyClass instances, while this will add 7 anonymous instances to the list variable:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: blue">var</span> list = <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">List</span>&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">MyClass</span>&gt;();
fixture.RepeatCount = 7;
fixture.AddManyTo(list);</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		AutoFixture provides some convenient methods for creating and managing collections of anonymous data. While it may seem simple (and it is), in a future post I will demonstrate how it can save you quit a bit of infrastructure code, and enable you to write unit tests that are shorter, more concise and more maintainable.
