    Some time ago, my good friend Martin Gildenpfennig from <a href="http://www.ative.dk/">Ative</a> made me aware that <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a> (among other things) is an generic implementation of the <a href="http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000714.html">Test Data Builder</a> pattern, and indeed it is.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the original Gang of Four definition of a Design Pattern, several people must independently have arrived at the same general solution to a given problem before we can call a coding idiom a true Pattern. In this spirit, the Test Data Builder pattern is on the verge of becoming a true Design Pattern, since I came up with AutoFixture without having heard about Test Data Builder :)
  </p>
  <p>
    The problem is the same: How do we create semantically correct test objects in a manner that is flexible and yet hides away irrelevant complexity?
  </p>
  <p>
    Like others before me, I tried the Object Mother (anti?)pattern and found it lacking. To me the answer was AutoFixture, a library that heuristically builds object graphs using Reflection and built-in rules for specific types.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although my original approach was different, you can certainly use AutoFixture as a generic Test Data Builder.
  </p>
  <p>
    To demonstrate this, let's work with this (oversimplified) Order object model:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/AutoFixtureAsTestDataBuilder_1371F/image_3.png" width="478" height="457"> 
  </p>
  <p>
    Assuming that we have an instance of the Fixture class (called <em>fixture</em>), we can create a new instance of the Order class with a ShippingAddress in Denmark:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre><span style="color: blue">var</span> order = fixture.Build&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">Order</span>&gt;()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .With(o =&gt; o.ShippingAddress, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fixture.Build&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">Address</span>&gt;()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .With(a =&gt; a.Country, <span style="color: #a31515">"Denmark"</span>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .CreateAnonymous())
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .CreateAnonymous();</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    While this works and follows the Test Data Builder pattern, I find this more concise and readable:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre><span style="color: blue">var</span> order = fixture.CreateAnonymous&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">Order</span>&gt;();
order.ShippingAddress.Country = <span style="color: #a31515">"Denmark"</span>;</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    The result is the same.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can also add anonymous order lines to the order using this fluent interface:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre><span style="color: blue">var</span> order = fixture.Build&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">Order</span>&gt;()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Do(o =&gt; fixture.AddManyTo(o.OrderLines))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .CreateAnonymous();</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    but again, I find it easier to simply let AutoFixture create a fully anonymous Order instance, and then afterwards modify the relevant parts:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre><span style="color: blue">var</span> order = fixture.CreateAnonymous&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">Order</span>&gt;();
fixture.AddManyTo(order.OrderLines);</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you prefer one style over the other, AutoFixture supports them both.
