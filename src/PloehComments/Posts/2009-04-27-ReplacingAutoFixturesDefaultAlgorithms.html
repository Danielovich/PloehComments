title: "Replacing AutoFixture's Default Algorithms"

<div id="post">
	<p>
		Several times in my previous <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a> posts, I've insinuated that you can change the algorithms used for creating strings, numbers and so on, if you don't like the defaults.
	</p>
	<p>
		One way you can do this is by simply using the <a href="/2009/04/23/DealingWithTypesWithoutPublicConstructors">Register method that I introduced in my previous post</a>. Let's say that you want to replace the string algorithm to simply return a specific string:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>fixture.Register&lt;<span style="color: blue">string</span>&gt;(() =&gt; <span style="color: #a31515">"ploeh"</span>);</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		No matter how many times you'll call CreateAnonymous&lt;string&gt; on that particular fixture object, it will always return <em>ploeh</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Register method is really only a type-safe convenience method that wraps access to the TypeMappings property. TypeMappings is just a Dictionary of types mapped to functions. By default, the Fixture class has a set of pre-defined TypeMappings for primitive types such as strings, numbers and booleans, so you could access the function used to generate strings by indexing into this Dictionary with the System.String type.
	</p>
	<p>
		Equivalent to the above example, you could alternatively replace the string algorithm like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>fixture.TypeMappings[<span style="color: blue">typeof</span>(<span style="color: blue">string</span>)] = s =&gt; <span style="color: #a31515">"fnaah"</span>;</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Instead of using the Register method, I here assign a lambda expression directly to the key identified by the System.String type. This is what the Register method does, so the result is exactly the same.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, you may have noticed that by accessing TypeMappings directly, the signature of the function is different. The Register method takes a Func&lt;T&gt;, whereas the TypeMappings Dictionary expects a Func&lt;object, object&gt;. As you can see, the Register method is more type-safe, but the TypeMappings Dictionary gives you a chance to utilize the optional seed that one of the CreateAnonymous overloads takes.
	</p>
	<p>
		You could, for example, do this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>fixture.TypeMappings[<span style="color: blue">typeof</span>(<span style="color: blue">string</span>)] = s =&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">string</span>.Format((<span style="color: blue">string</span>)s, <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">Random</span>().Next(100));</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Although this particular algorithm has a built-in weakness (can you spot it?), we can now use the seed to provide a format string, like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color: blue">string</span> result = fixture.CreateAnonymous(<span style="color: #a31515">"Risk: {0}%"</span>);</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		which will yield a result like <em>Risk: 32%</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I designed the extensibility mechanism for AutoFixture, I seriously considered defining an interface that all TypeMappings had to implement, but I ended up preferring a Func&lt;object, object&gt; instead, since this allows you to redefine a particular algorithm inline in a test by using an anonymous delegate or lambda expression, and you can also reuse an existing algorithm, as long as it fits the signature.

	<div class="comment-content">Yes, TypeMappings were removed in AutoFixture 2.0, which has a much more flexible extensibility model. Ultimately, <a href="/2010/10/19/Convention-basedCustomizationswithAutoFixture">a custom ISpecimenBuilder</a> can do everything you may want to do.</div>
