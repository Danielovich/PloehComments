title: "Custom Tokens Over Non-HTTP Transports"

    About a year ago, one of my readers <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ploeh/archive/2008/05/01/DeclarativeUseOfCustomSecurityTokenParameters.aspx#8575741">asked me about how to make custom tokens work over TPC</a> in WCF. Here's the question again:
  </p>
  <p>
    "i'm trying to implement the CustomToken over tcp. The original used the SymmetricSecurityBindingElement and the transport http, this works fine, but when i change URI's and and the transport, it gives an error saying:
  </p>
  <p>
    "Binding 'CustomBinding' doesn't support creating any channel types. This often indicates that the BindingElements in a CustomBinding have been stacked incorrectly or in the wrong order. A Transport is required at the bottom of the stack. The recommended order for BindingElements is: TransactionFlow, ReliableSession, Security, CompositeDuplex, OneWay, StreamSecurity, MessageEncoding, Transport."
  </p>
  <p>
    As it turns out, this seems to be a general issue with more transports than just TCP  -  at least, I've seen the exact same behavior for the Named Pipes transport.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I originally received the question, it seemed that no-one knew the answer, and neither did I. Now, about a year later, I've managed to find a solution, and it's really simple.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you build up your CustomBinding in code, all you need to do is set the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.servicebus.channels.connectionorientedtransportbindingelement.transfermode.aspx">TransferMode</a> property to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.transfermode.aspx">Streamed</a>:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre><span style="color: blue">var</span> pipeTransport = <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">NamedPipeTransportBindingElement</span>();
pipeTransport.TransferMode = <span style="color: #2b91af">TransferMode</span>.Streamed;</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    In this example, I'm setting the property on a Named Pipe transport, but you can do exactly the same with a TCP transport.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although I wasn't able to find any documentation to that effect, experimentation seems to indicate that you can also set the property in a .config file (at least, it works on my computer):
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre><span style="color: blue">&lt;</span><span style="color: #a31515">namedPipeTransport</span><span style="color: blue"> </span><span style="color: red">transferMode</span><span style="color: blue">=</span>"<span style="color: blue">Streamed</span>"<span style="color: blue"> /&gt;</span></pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    I will not claim that I fully understand this fix/workaround, or that it applies in every situation, but I hope that it might prove helpful to some of my readers some day.
