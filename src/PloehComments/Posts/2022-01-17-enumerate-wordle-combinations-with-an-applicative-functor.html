	</p>
	<p>
		Like so many others, I recently started solving the daily <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">Wordle</a> puzzle. As is normal when one is a beginner, I initially struggled a bit. One day, I couldn't find a good word to proceed.
	</p>
	<p>
		To be clear, this article isn't really about Wordle strategies or tools. Rather, it's an example of ad-hoc programming. Particularly, it's an example of how the <a href="/2018/10/01/applicative-functors">applicative</a> nature of lists can be useful when you need to enumerate combinations. While I've <a href="/2018/10/15/an-applicative-password-list">previously shown a similar example</a>, I think one more is warranted.

	<p>
		Last Monday, I'd started with the word <em>TEARS</em>. (I've subsequently learned that better starting words exist.) The puzzle responded with a yellow <em>E</em> and a green <em>R:</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="/content/binary/wordle-tears.png" alt="Wordle after entering TEARS.">
	</p>
	<p>
		In case you haven't played the game, this means that the fourth letter of the hidden word <em>is</em> an <em>R</em>, and that the word also contains an <em>E</em>. The second letter, however, is <em>not</em> an <em>E</em>. Also, the hidden word contains neither <em>T</em>, <em>A</em>, nor <em>S</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		While the green and yellow letters may be repeated, you only have six guesses, so it's a good idea to attempt to exhaust as many letters as possible. The first compatible word with five distinct letters that I could think of was <em>INURE</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="/content/binary/wordle-tears-inure.png" alt="Wordle after entering TEARS and INURE.">
	</p>
	<p>
		This gave me a bit of new information. The hidden word also contains a <em>U</em>, but not as the third letter. Furthermore, the <em>E</em> isn't the last letter either. Keep in mind that from <em>TEARS</em> we also know that <em>E</em> isn't the second letter.
	</p>
	<p>
		While I believe myself to have a decent English vocabulary, at this point I was stuck. While I knew that the <em>E</em> had to be in either first or third position, I couldn't think of a single word that fit all observations.
	</p>
	<p>
		After trying to come up with a word for ten minutes, I decided that, instead of giving up, I'd use the applicative nature of lists to generate all possible combinations. I was hoping that with the observations already in place, there wouldn't be too many to sift through.

	<p>
		While you could do this in other languages (such as <a href="https://fsharp.org">F#</a> or C#), it's natural to use <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> because it natively understands applicative functors. Thus, I launched GHCi (<em>Glasgow Haskell Compiler interactive</em> - the Haskell <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		Wordle is kind enough to show a keyboard with colour-coded keys:
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="/content/binary/wordle-keyboard.png" alt="Wordle keyboard.">
	</p>
	<p>
		All letters except the dark ones remain valid, so I first defined a list of all available letters:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; avail = "QWERYUOPDFGHJKLZXCVBM"</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The variable <code>avail</code> is a <code>String</code>, but in Haskell, a <code>String</code> is a type synonym for a (linked) list of <code>Char</code> values (characters). Since lists form an applicative functor, that'll work.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most of the letters are still in play - only five letters are already out of the picture: <em>T</em>, <em>I</em>, <em>A</em>, <em>S</em>, and <em>N</em>. Thus, <code>avail</code>still spells out most of the alphabet.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, I wrote an expression that enumerates all five-letter combinations of these letters, with one constraint: The fourth letter must be an <em>R:</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; candidates = (\x y z æ ø -&gt; [x,y,z,æ,ø]) &lt;$&gt; avail &lt;*&gt; avail &lt;*&gt; avail &lt;*&gt; "R" &lt;*&gt; avail</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The leftmost expression (<code>(\x y z æ ø -&gt; [x,y,z,æ,ø])</code>) is a lambda expression that takes five values (one from each list of available letters) and combines them to a single list. Each value (<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and so on) is a <code>Char</code> value, and since <code>String</code> in Haskell is the same as <code>[Char]</code>, the expression <code>[x,y,z,æ,ø]</code> is a <code>String</code>. In Danish we have three more letters after <code>z</code>, so I after I ran out of the the usual Latin letters, I just continued with the Danish <code>æ</code> and <code>ø</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that between each of the <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> operators (<em>apply</em>) I've supplied the list of available letters. In the fourth position there's no choice, so there the list contains only a single letter. Recall that a <code>String</code> is a list of characters, so <code>"R"</code> is the same as <code>['R']</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		How many combinations are there? Let's ask GHCi:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; length candidates
194481</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Almost 200,000. That's a bit much to look through, but we can peek at the first ten as a sanity check:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; take 10 candidates
["QQQRQ","QQQRW","QQQRE","QQQRR","QQQRY","QQQRU","QQQRO","QQQRP","QQQRD","QQQRF"]</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		There are no promising words in this little list, but I never expected that.
	</p>
	<p>
		I needed to narrow down the options.
	</p>
	<h3 id="78f6d90a9b3a43649fa97f525b52f980">
		Filtering <a href="#78f6d90a9b3a43649fa97f525b52f980" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		How do you make a collection smaller? You could filter it.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>candidates</code> contains illegal values. For example, the third value in the above list (of the ten first candidates) is <code>"QQQRE"</code>. Yet, we know (from the <em>INURE</em> attempt) that the last letter isn't <em>E</em>. We can filter out all strings that end with <code>E</code>:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; take 10 $ filter (\s -&gt; s!!4 /= 'E') candidates
["QQQRQ","QQQRW","QQQRR","QQQRY","QQQRU","QQQRO","QQQRP","QQQRD","QQQRF","QQQRG"]</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		In Haskell, <code>!!</code> is the indexing operator, so <code>s!!4</code> means the (zero-based) fourth element of the string <code>s</code>. <code>/=</code> is the inequality operator, so the lambda expression <code>(\s -&gt; s!!4 /= 'E')</code> identifies all strings where the fifth element (or fourth element, when starting from zero) is different from <code>E</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		We know more than this, though. We also know that the second element can't be <em>E</em>, and that the third element isn't <em>U</em>, so add those predicates to the <code>filter</code>:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; take 10 $ filter (\s -&gt; s!!1 /= 'E' && s!!2 /= 'U' && s!!4 /= 'E') candidates
["QQQRQ","QQQRW","QQQRR","QQQRY","QQQRU","QQQRO","QQQRP","QQQRD","QQQRF","QQQRG"]</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		How many are left?
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; length $ filter (\s -&gt; s!!1 /= 'E' && s!!2 /= 'U' && s!!4 /= 'E') candidates
168000</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Still too many, but we aren't done yet.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that all of the first ten values shown above are invalid. Why? Because the word must contain at least one <em>E</em>, and none of them do. Let's add that predicate:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; take 10 $ filter (\s -&gt; s!!1 /= 'E' && s!!2 /= 'U' && s!!4 /= 'E' && 'E' `elem` s) candidates
["QQERQ","QQERW","QQERR","QQERY","QQERU","QQERO","QQERP","QQERD","QQERF","QQERG"]</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The Boolean expression <code>'E' `elem` s</code> means that the character <code>'E'</code> must be an element of the string (list) <code>s</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The same rule applies for <em>U:</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; take 10 $ filter (\s -&gt; s!!1 /= 'E' && s!!2 /= 'U' && s!!4 /= 'E' && 'E' `elem` s && 'U' `elem` s)
    candidates
["QQERU","QWERU","QRERU","QYERU","QUERQ","QUERW","QUERR","QUERY","QUERU","QUERO"]</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		There's a great suggestion already! The eighth entry spells <em>QUERY!</em> Let's try it:
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="/content/binary/wordle-tears-inure-query.png" alt="Wordle after entering TEARS, INURE and QUERY.">
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>QUERY</em> was the word of the day!
	</p>
	<p>
		A bit embarrassing that I couldn't think of <em>query</em>, given that I often discuss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation">Command Query Separation</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Was that just pure luck? How many suggestions are left in the filtered list?
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; length $ filter (\s -&gt; s!!1 /= 'E' && s!!2 /= 'U' && s!!4 /= 'E' && 'E' `elem` s && 'U' `elem` s)
    candidates
1921</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Okay, a bit lucky. If I ask GHCi to display the filtered list in its entirety, no other word jumps out at me, looking like a real word.
	</p>

	</h3>
	<p>
		While I admit that I was a bit lucky that <em>QUERY</em> was among the first ten of 1,921 possible combinations, I still find that applicative combinations are handy as an ad-hoc tool. I'm sure there are more elegant ways to solve a problem like this one, but for me, this approach had <a href="/2019/12/16/zone-of-ceremony">low ceremony</a>. It was a few lines of code in a terminal. Once I had the answer, I could just close the terminal and no further clean-up was required.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm sure other people have other tool preferences, and perhaps you'd like to <a href="https://github.com/ploeh/ploeh.github.com#comments">leave a comment</a> to the effect that you have a better way with Bash, Python, or APL. That's OK, and I don't mind learning new tricks.
	</p>
	<p>
		I do find this capability of applicative functors to do combinatorics occasionally useful, though.
