		One of my clients was kind enough to show me some of their legacy code. As I was struggling to understand how it worked, I encountered something like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;A&nbsp;lot&nbsp;of&nbsp;code&nbsp;has&nbsp;come&nbsp;before&nbsp;this.&nbsp;This&nbsp;is&nbsp;really&nbsp;on&nbsp;line&nbsp;665,&nbsp;column&nbsp;29.</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#8f08c4;">foreach</span>&nbsp;(<span style="color:#2b91af;">BARLifeScheme_BAR</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">scheme</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#8f08c4;">in</span>

{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">schemeCalculated</span>&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span style="color:#2b91af;">BARLifeSchemeCalculated_BAR</span>)<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">scheme</span>.SchemeCalculatedObsolete[<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">basis</span>.Data.Basis1order];
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">decimal</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">hfcFactor</span>;
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#8f08c4;">if</span>&nbsp;(<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">postState</span>.OverallFuturerule&nbsp;==&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">BAROverallFuturerule</span>.Standard)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">bonusKey</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">BonusKey</span>(<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">postState</span>.<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#74531f;">PNr</span>());

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#74531f;">CostProvider</span>(<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">postState</span>.Data.FrameContractNr,&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">postState</span>.StateDate)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#74531f;">GetAdministrationpercentageContribution</span>(<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">bonusKey</span>,&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">basis</span>.Data.Basis1order)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;100M;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;Much&nbsp;more&nbsp;code&nbsp;comes&nbsp;after&nbsp;this...</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;...and&nbsp;after&nbsp;this...</span>
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		For the record, this isn't the actual code that my client gave me. I wouldn't post someone else's code without their permission. It is, however, a faithful imitation of the original code.
	</p>
	<p>
		The actual code started at line 665 and further to the right. It was part of a larger block of code with <code>if</code> statements within <code>foreach</code> loops within <code>if</code> statements within <code>foreach</code> loops, and so on. The <code>foreach</code> keyword actually appeared at column 29. The entire file was 1708 lines long.
	</p>
	<p>
		The code has numerous smells, but here I'll focus on a single oddity.
	</p>

		Inexplicable bracket <a href="#62fa371342be48698054d125b8b326e0" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Notice the curly bracket on the line before <code>hfcFactor</code>. Why is it there?
	</p>
	<p>
		Take a moment and see if you can guess.
	</p>
	<p>
		It doesn't seem to be required. It just surrounds a block of code, but it belongs to none of the usual language constructs that would normally call for the use of curly brackets. There's no <code>if</code>, <code>foreach</code>, <code>using</code>, or <code>try</code> before it.
	</p>

		Residue <a href="#f56822a0b88d4d288843723fece26f76" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		I formed a theory as to why those brackets where in place. I thought that it might be the residue of an <code>if</code> statement that was no longer there; that, perhaps, once the code had looked like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#8f08c4;">if</span>&nbsp;(<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">something</span>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">somethingElse</span>)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">decimal</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">hfcFactor</span>;</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Later, a developer had discovered that the code in that block should <em>always</em> be executed, and had removed the <code>if</code> statement without removing the curly brackets.
	</p>
	<p>
		That was my theory, but then I noticed that this structure appeared frequently throughout the code. Mysterious curly brackets were common, sometimes even nesting each other.
	</p>
	<p>
		This idiom appeared too often that it looked like the legacy from earlier epochs. It looked deliberate.
	</p>

		The real reason <a href="#1b30ee97ed92442caf8d054b4239e334" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		When I had the opportunity, I asked one of the developers.
	</p>
	<p>
		He smiled sheepishly when he told me that those curly brackets were there to introduce a <em>variable scope</em>. The curly brackets protected variables within them from colliding with other variables elsewhere in the 744-line method.
	</p>
	<p>
		Those scopes enabled programmers to declare variables with names that would otherwise collide with other variables. They even enabled developers to declare a variable with the same name, but a different type.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was appalled.
	</p>

	</h3>
	<p>
		I didn't write this article to point fingers. I don't think that professional software developers deliberately decide to write obscure code.
	</p>
	<p>
		Code becomes obscure over time. It's a slow, unyielding process. As Brian Foote and Joseph Yoder wrote in <em>The Selfish Class</em> (here quoted from <a href="http://amzn.to/1dEKjcj">Pattern Languages of Program Design 3</a>, p. 461):
		<blockquote>
			<p>"Will highly comprehensible code, by virtue of being easy to modify, inevitably be supplanted by increasingly less elegant code until some equilibrium is achieved between comprehensibility and fragility?"</p>
			<footer><cite>Brian Foote and Joseph Yoder</cite></footer>
		</blockquote>
		That's a disturbing thought. It suggests that 'good' code is unstable. I suspect that code tends to rot beyond comprehension. It's death by a thousand cuts. It's not any single edit that produces legacy code. It's the glacial, inexorable slide towards increasingly complicated code.

		Conclusion <a href="#76d3bcfd084247ed8eb9c11239c7523c" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Methods may grow to such sizes that variables collide. The solution isn't to add artificial variable scopes. The solution is to extract helper methods. <a href="/2019/11/04/the-80-24-rule">Keep methods small</a>.
