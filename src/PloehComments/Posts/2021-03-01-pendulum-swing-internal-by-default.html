		This is an article in <a href="/2021/02/22/pendulum-swings">a small series of articles about personal pendulum swings</a>. Here, I document a recent change of heart that's been a long way coming. In short, I now declare C# classes as <code>internal</code> unless they're driven by tests.
	</p>
	<p>
		<ins datetime="2021-06-15T06:14Z">The code shown here is part of the sample code base that accompanies my book <a href="/code-that-fits-in-your-head">Code That Fits in Your Head</a>.</ins>

	<p>
		When you create a new class in Visual Studio, the default accessibility is <code>internal</code>. In fact, Visual Studio's default templates don't add an access modifier at all, but if no access modifier is present, it implies <code>internal</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I started out programming C#, I don't recall thinking much about accessibility modifiers. By default, then, I'd be using mostly <code>internal</code> classes. What little I knew about encapsulation (<em>information hiding</em>, anyone?) led me to believe that the more <code>internal</code> my code was, the better encapsulation it had.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's possible that I make my past self more ignorant than I actually was. It's almost twenty years ago: I don't recall all the details.
	</p>

		Public all the things <a href="#c98c637b240f4f0c97d6fc4d0f7d10f2" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		When I discovered test-driven development (TDD) (circa 2003) all my classes became public. They had to. When tests are interacting with code in another library, they can only exercise the system under test (SUT) if they can reach it. The tests make the SUT classes public.
	</p>
	<p>
		Yes, it's technically possible to test <code>internal</code> classes in .NET, but <a href="/2015/09/22/unit-testing-internals">I don't believe that you should</a>. I've yet to change my mind about that; no imminent pendulum swing there. You're testing something you <em>care</em> about. If the <code>internal</code> code serves any, <em>any</em>, purpose, it must be somehow observable. If so, verify that such observable behaviour takes place; if not, delete the code. (I'm sure you can dream up some corner cases where this doesn't hold; fine: I'm painting with a broad brush, here.)
	</p>
	<p>
		For years, I applied TDD, but I wasn't aware of the red-green-refactor cycle. I rarely changed the public API that the tests interacted with, and when I did, I made sure to adjust the tests accordingly. If a refactoring gave rise to new classes, I'd often write tests for those new classes as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		Imagine, for example, invoking the <em>Extract Class</em> refactoring. The new class would be as covered by tests as before the extraction, but what happens next is typically that you need to tweak it. When that happened to me, I'd typically write completely new tests to cover it. To do that, I'd need the extracted class to be <code>public</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this phase of my professional life, my classes were almost exclusively <code>public</code>, with <code>internal</code> classes only making a rare appearance.
	</p>
	<p>
		One problem this tends to cause is that it makes code bases more brittle. Every type change is a potential breaking change. When every public class is covered by tests, this makes tests brittle.
	</p>
	<p>
		I think that it's relevant to consider the context of the code base. At this phase of my professional life, I maintained <a href="https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture">AutoFixture</a>, a fairly popular open-source library. I wanted that library to be stable so that users could trust it. I considered the test suite a guard of the contract. As long as a change didn't break any test, I considered it likely that it wasn't a breaking change. Thus, I was already conservative when it came to editing tests. I <a href="/2013/04/02/why-trust-tests">considered test to be append-only</a> in principle.
	</p>
	<p>
		I still consider it prudent to be conservative when it comes to a library with a public API. This doesn't mean, however, that this line of thinking carries over to code bases without a public (language-level) API. This may include web sites and services, but could also include installed apps. As long as there's no public API, there's no contract to break.
	</p>

	<p>
		In 2020 I wrote a REST API of middling complexity. I used <a href="/outside-in-tdd">outside-in TDD</a> as a major driver. In the spirit of behaviour-driven development I favour describing the observable behaviour of the system. I use <a href="/2021/01/25/self-hosted-integration-tests-in-aspnet">self-hosted</a> <a href="/2019/02/18/from-interaction-based-to-state-based-testing">state-based integration tests</a> for this purpose. Only when I find that these tests get too complex do I grudgingly drop down to the unit-test level.
	</p>
	<p>
		The things that I test with unit tests have to be <code>public</code>. This still leaves plenty of room for behaviour described by the integration tests to have <code>internal</code> implementation details. The code base I mentioned has several examples of that. Some of them I've already described here on the blog.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, notice that the <code>LinksFilter</code> <a href="/2020/08/24/adding-rest-links-as-a-cross-cutting-concern">shown here</a> is an <code>internal</code> class. Its behaviour is covered by abundant integration tests, so I'm not afraid to refactor it if need be. Those <code>LinkToYear</code>, <code>LinkToMonth</code>, and <code>LinkToDay</code> extension methods that it uses <a href="/2020/08/10/an-aspnet-core-url-builder">are internal too</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another example is the <code>UrlIntegrityFilter</code> <a href="/2020/11/09/checking-signed-urls-with-aspnet">seen here</a>. The class itself is <code>internal</code> and its behaviour is composed from <code>private</code> helper functions. Its <a href="/2020/11/02/signing-urls-with-aspnet">counterpart</a> <code>SigningUrlHelper</code> is also <code>internal</code>. (Its companion <code>SigningUrlHelperFactory</code>, shown in the same article, is <code>public</code>, but that's an oversight on my part. It can easily be <code>internal</code> as well.) All that URL-signing behaviour is, again, covered by tests that verify the behaviour of the REST API.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another example from the same code base can be found in its so-called <em>calendar</em> feature. The system is an online restaurant reservation system. It allows clients to browse a day, a month, or even a year to see if there are any free spots for a given time slot. You can <a href="/2020/08/24/adding-rest-links-as-a-cross-cutting-concern">see an example here</a>. While I test-drove the calendar feature with integration tests, it quickly dawned on me that I had three disparate cases (day, month, year) that essentially represented the same concept: a <em>period</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		A period is a closed set of heterogeneous data. A year contains only a single datum: the year itself (e.g. 2021). A month contains both a month and a year, and so on. A closed set of heterogeneous data describes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union">sum type</a>, and since I know that in object-oriented programming, <a href="/2018/06/25/visitor-as-a-sum-type">sum types can be encoded as Visitors</a>, I introduced a Visitor API:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">internal</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">interface</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IPeriod</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&nbsp;Accept&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&gt;(<span style="color:#2b91af;">IPeriodVisitor</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&gt;&nbsp;visitor);
}

<span style="color:blue;">internal</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">interface</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IPeriodVisitor</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&gt;
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&nbsp;VisitYear(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;year);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&nbsp;VisitMonth(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;year,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;month);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&nbsp;VisitDay(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;year,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;month,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;day);
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		I decided, however, to keep this API <code>internal</code>, since this isn't the only possible way to model this feature. As is the case with the other examples I've shown here, the behaviour is covered by integration tests. I feel free to refactor. In fact, this Visitor-based API is actually the result of a refactoring from something more ad hoc that I didn't like.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here's one of the three <code>IPeriod</code> implementation, in case you're curious:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">internal</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">sealed</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">class</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Month</span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IPeriod</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">private</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">readonly</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;year;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">private</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">readonly</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;month;
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Month</span>(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;year,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;month)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">this</span>.year&nbsp;=&nbsp;year;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">this</span>.month&nbsp;=&nbsp;month;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&nbsp;Accept&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&gt;(<span style="color:#2b91af;">IPeriodVisitor</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&gt;&nbsp;visitor)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;visitor.VisitMonth(year,&nbsp;month);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">override</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">bool</span>&nbsp;Equals(<span style="color:blue;">object</span>?&nbsp;obj)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;obj&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">is</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Month</span>&nbsp;month&nbsp;&amp;&amp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year&nbsp;==&nbsp;month.year&nbsp;&amp;&amp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">this</span>.month&nbsp;==&nbsp;month.month;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">override</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;GetHashCode()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">HashCode</span>.Combine(year,&nbsp;month);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This class, too, is <code>internal</code>, as are its two companions <code>Day</code> and <code>Year</code>. I'll leave it as an exercise for the interested reader to implement these two classes, as well as <code>IPeriodVisitor&lt;T&gt;</code> implementations that return the next or previous period, or the first or last tick of the period, etcetera.
	</p>
	<h3 id="af9c22ec88af4e3fa5f4b5c2356b5692">
		Public by choice <a href="#af9c22ec88af4e3fa5f4b5c2356b5692" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		This shifted emphasis of mine isn't a return to a simpler time. It's not <em>internal all the things!</em> It's about shifting the default for classes that are <em>not</em> driven by tests. Those classes that are artefacts of TDD are still <code>public</code> since <a href="/2015/09/22/unit-testing-internals">I don't directly unit test internal classes</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Other classes may start out as <code>internal</code> and then get promoted to <code>public</code> by choice. For example, I'd introduced a <code>Seating</code> class in the code base to model how long a seating was supposed to take:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">internal</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">sealed</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">class</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Seating</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">internal</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Seating</span>(<span style="color:#2b91af;">TimeSpan</span>&nbsp;seatingDuration,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Reservation</span>&nbsp;reservation)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SeatingDuration&nbsp;=&nbsp;seatingDuration;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reservation&nbsp;=&nbsp;reservation;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;Members&nbsp;follow...</span></pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Some restaurants have second seatings (or more). They give you a predefined duration after which you're supposed to be done so that they can reuse your table for another party. I'd used the <code>Seating</code> class to encapsulate some logic related to that, such as the <code>Overlaps</code> method:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">internal</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">DateTime</span>&nbsp;Start
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">get</span>&nbsp;{&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;Reservation.At;&nbsp;}
}
 
<span style="color:blue;">internal</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">DateTime</span>&nbsp;End
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">get</span>&nbsp;{&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;Start&nbsp;+&nbsp;SeatingDuration;&nbsp;}
}
 
<span style="color:blue;">internal</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">bool</span>&nbsp;Overlaps(<span style="color:#2b91af;">Reservation</span>&nbsp;other)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;otherSeating&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Seating</span>(SeatingDuration,&nbsp;other);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;Start&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;otherSeating.End&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;otherSeating.Start&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;End;
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		While I considered this a well-designed little class with good encapsulation, I kept it <code>internal</code> simply because there was no need to make it <code>public</code>. It was indirectly covered by test cases, but it was a result of a refactoring and not directly test-driven.
	</p>
	<p>
		As I started to add a new feature, I realised that I'd be able to write new unit tests in a better way if I could reuse <code>Seating</code> and a variation of its <code>Overlaps</code> method. I considered it carefully and decided to make the class and its members public:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">sealed</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">class</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Seating</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Seating</span>(<span style="color:#2b91af;">TimeSpan</span>&nbsp;seatingDuration,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Reservation</span>&nbsp;reservation)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SeatingDuration&nbsp;=&nbsp;seatingDuration;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reservation&nbsp;=&nbsp;reservation;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;Members&nbsp;follow...</span></pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		I made this decision after explicit deliberation. It didn't take long, though, but I did shortly stop to consider whether this seemed like a good idea. This code base isn't a <a href="/2012/12/18/RangersandZookeepers">reusable library in the wild</a>, so I wasn't concerned about misuse of the API. I did consider, on the other hand, how this would increase coupling between the tests and the production code base. It didn't take me long to decide that in this case, I was okay with that.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Seating</code> had already existed as an <code>internal</code> class for some time and had proven useful and stable. Putting on my <a href="http://amzn.to/WBCwx7">DDD</a> hat, I also thought that <code>Seating</code> represented a proper domain concept.
	</p>
	<h3 id="f6ef0cc965d845fe889170ee956baa4d">
		Conclusion <a href="#f6ef0cc965d845fe889170ee956baa4d" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		You can go back and forth on how you write code; which rules of thumb you apply. For many years, I favoured <code>public</code> classes. I think that I even, at one time, tweaked the Visual Studio templates to explicitly create new classes as <code>public</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, I've changed my heuristic. Classes driven into existence by tests are <code>public</code>; they have to be. Other classes I now make <em>internal by default, and public by choice</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is going to be my rule until I change it.
