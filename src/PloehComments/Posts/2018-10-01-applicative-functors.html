		This article series is part of <a href="/2018/03/19/functors-applicatives-and-friends">a larger series of articles about functors, applicatives, and other mappable containers</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In a <a href="/2018/03/22/functors">former article series</a>, you learned about functors, and how they also exist in object-oriented design. Perhaps the utility of this still eludes you, although, if you've ever had experience with LINQ in C#, you should realise that the abstraction is invaluable. Functors are abundant; <em>applicative functors</em> not quite so much. On the other hand, applicative functors enable you to <em>do</em> more.
	</p>
	<p>
		I find it helpful to think of applicative functors as an abstraction that enable you to express <em>combinations</em> of things.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the functor article series, I mostly focused on the mechanics of implementation. In this article series, I think that you'll find it helpful to slightly change the perspective. In these articles, I'll show you various motivating examples of how applicative functors are useful.

		A normal functor maps objects in an 'elevated world' (like C#'s <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> or <code>IObservable&lt;T&gt;</code>) using a function in the 'normal world'. As a variation, an applicative functor maps objects in an 'elevated world' using functions from the same 'elevated world'.
	</p>
	<p>
		In <a href="https://haskell.org">Haskell</a>, an applicative functor is defined <em>like</em> this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">class</span>&nbsp;Functor&nbsp;f&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">Applicative</span>&nbsp;f&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">where</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#600277;">pure</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;::&nbsp;a&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;f&nbsp;a
&nbsp;&nbsp;(&lt;*<span style="color:blue;">&gt;</span>)&nbsp;::&nbsp;f&nbsp;(a&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;b)&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;f&nbsp;a&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;f&nbsp;b
</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This is a <strong>simplification</strong>; there's more to the <code>Applicative</code> typeclass than this, but this should highlight the essence. What it says is that an applicative functor must already be a <code>Functor</code>. It could be any sort of <code>Functor</code>, like <code>[]</code> (linked list), <code>Maybe</code>, <code>Either</code>, and so on. Since <code>Functor</code> is an abstraction, it's called <code>f</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The definition furthermore says that in order for a functor to be applicative, two functions must exist: <code>pure</code> and <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> (<em>'apply'</em>).
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>pure</code> is easy to understand. It simply 'elevates' a 'normal' value to a functor value. For example, you can elevate the number <code>42</code> to a list value by putting it in a list with a single element: <code>[42]</code>. Or you can elevate <code>"foo"</code> to <code>Maybe</code> by containing it in the <code>Just</code> case: <code>Just "foo"</code>. That is, literally, what <code>pure</code> does for <code>[]</code> (list) and <code>Maybe</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> operator applies an 'elevated' function to an 'elevated' value. When <code>f</code> is <code>[]</code>, this literally means that you have a list of functions that you have to apply to a list of values. Perhaps you can already see what I meant by <em>combinations</em> of things.
	</p>
	<p>
		This sounds abstract, but follow the above list of links in order to see several examples.
	</p>

	<p>
		Applicative functors aren't explicitly modelled in <a href="https://fsharp.org">F#</a>, but they're easy enough to add if you need them. F# doesn't have typeclasses, so implementing applicative functors tend to be more on a case-by-case basis.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you need <code>list</code> to be applicative, <code>pure</code> should have the type <code>'a -&gt; 'a list</code>, and <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> should have the type <code>('a -&gt; 'b) list -&gt; 'a list -&gt; 'b list</code>. At this point, you already run into the problem that <code>pure</code> is a reserved keyword in F#, so you'll have to find another name, or simply ignore that function.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you need <code>option</code> to be applicative, <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> should have the type <code>('a -&gt; 'b) option -&gt; 'a option -&gt; 'b option</code>. Now you run into your second problem, because which function is <code>&lt;*&gt;</code>? The one for <code>list</code>, or the one for <code>option</code>? It can't be both, so you'll have to resort to all sorts of hygiene to prevent these two versions of the same operator from clashing. This somewhat limits its usefulness.
	</p>
	<p>
		Again, refer to the above list of linked articles for concrete examples.

	</h3>
	<p>
		Applicative functors push the limits of what you can express in C#, but the equivalent to <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> would be a method with this signature:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">static</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Functor</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;&nbsp;Apply&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">this</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Functor</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Func</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;selector,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Functor</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&gt;&nbsp;source)</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Here, the class <code>Functor&lt;T&gt;</code> is a place-holder for a proper functor class. A concrete example could be for <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">static</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IEnumerable</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;&nbsp;Apply&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">this</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IEnumerable</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Func</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;selectors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IEnumerable</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&gt;&nbsp;source)</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		As you can see, here you somehow have to figure out how to combine a sequence of functions with a sequence of values.
	</p>
	<p>
		In some of the examples in the above list of linked articles, you'll see how this will stretch the capability of C#.

	<p>
		This article only attempts to provide an overview of applicative functors, while examples are given in linked articles. I find it helpful to think of applicative functors as an abstraction that enables you to model arbitrary <em>combinations</em> of objects. This is a core feature in Haskell, occasionally useful in F#, and somewhat alien to C#.
