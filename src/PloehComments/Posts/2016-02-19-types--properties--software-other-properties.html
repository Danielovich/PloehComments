		This article is the eighth in <a href="/2016/02/10/types-properties-software">a series of articles that demonstrate how to develop software using types and properties</a>. In previous articles, you've seen an extensive example of how to solve <a href="http://www.codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataTennis">the Tennis Kata</a> with type design and Property-Based Testing. Specifically, in <a href="/2016/02/12/types-properties-software-properties-for-the-advantage-state">the third article</a>, you saw the introduction of a function called <code>other</code>. In that article we didn't cover that function with automatic tests, but this article rectifies that omission.
	</p>
	<p>
		The source code for this article series is <a href="https://github.com/ploeh/KataTennis">available on GitHub</a>.

	</h3>
	<p>
		The <code>other</code> function is used to find the opponent of a player. The implementation is trivial:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">other</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">function</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">PlayerOne</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">PlayerTwo</span>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">PlayerTwo</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">PlayerOne</span>
</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Unless you're developing software where lives, or extraordinary amounts of money, are at stake, you probably need not test such a trivial function. I'm still going to show you how you could do this, mostly because it's a good example of how Property-Based Testing can sometimes help you test the <em>behaviour</em> of a function, instead of the implementation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before I show you that, however, I'll show you why example-based unit tests are inadequate for testing this function.
	</p>
	<p>
		You could test this function using examples, and because the space of possible input is so small, you can even cover it in its entirety:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>[&lt;<span style="color:#4ec9b0;">Fact</span>&gt;]
<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">``other&nbsp;than&nbsp;playerOne&nbsp;returns&nbsp;correct&nbsp;result``</span>&nbsp;()&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">PlayerTwo</span>&nbsp;=!&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">other</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">PlayerOne</span>
 
[&lt;<span style="color:#4ec9b0;">Fact</span>&gt;]
<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">``other&nbsp;than&nbsp;playerTwo&nbsp;returns&nbsp;correct&nbsp;result``</span>&nbsp;()&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">PlayerOne</span>&nbsp;=!&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">other</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">PlayerTwo</span></pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The <code>=!</code> operator is a custom operator defined by <a href="http://www.swensensoftware.com/unquote">Unquote</a>, an assertion library. You can read the first expression as <em>player two must equal other than player one</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The problem with these tests, however, is that they don't state anything not already stated by the implementation itself. Basically, what these tests state is that <em>if the input is PlayerOne, the output is PlayerTwo, and if the input is PlayerTwo, the output is PlayerOne</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		That's exactly what the implementation does.
	</p>
	<p>
		The only important difference is that the implementation of <code>other</code> states this relationship more succinctly than the tests.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's as though the tests duplicate the information already in the implementation. How does that add value?
	</p>
	<p>
		Sometimes, this can be the only way to cover functionality with tests, but in this case, there's an alternative.
	</p>

	</h3>
	<p>
		Property-Based Testing inspires you to think about the observable behaviour of a system, rather than the implementation. Which properties do the <code>other</code> function have?
	</p>
	<p>
		If you call it with a Player value, you'd expect it to return a Player value that's not the input value:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>[&lt;<span style="color:#4ec9b0;">Property</span>&gt;]
<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">``other&nbsp;returns&nbsp;a&nbsp;different&nbsp;player``</span>&nbsp;player&nbsp;=&nbsp;player&nbsp;&lt;&gt;!&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">other</span>&nbsp;player</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The <code>&lt;&gt;!</code> operator is another custom operator defined by Unquote. You can read the expression as <em>player must not equal other player</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This property alone doesn't completely define the behaviour of <code>other</code>, but combined with the next property, it does:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>[&lt;<span style="color:#4ec9b0;">Property</span>&gt;]
<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">``other&nbsp;other&nbsp;returns&nbsp;same&nbsp;player``</span>&nbsp;player&nbsp;=&nbsp;player&nbsp;=!&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">other</span>&nbsp;(<span style="color:navy;">other</span>&nbsp;player)</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you call <code>other</code>, and then you take the output of that call and use it as input to call <code>other</code> again, you should get the original Player value. This property is an excellent example of what <a href="http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/property-based-testing-2">Scott Wlaschin calls <em>there and back again</em></a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		These two properties, together, describe the behaviour of the <code>other</code> function, without going into details about the implementation.
	</p>

	<p>
		You've seen a simple example of how to describe the properties of a function without resorting to duplicating the implementation in the tests. You may not always be able to do this, but it always feels right when you can.
