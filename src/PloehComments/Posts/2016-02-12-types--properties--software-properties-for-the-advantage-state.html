		This article is the third in <a href="/2016/02/10/types-properties-software">a series of articles that demonstrate how to develop software using types and properties</a>. In the <a href="/2016/02/11/types-properties-software-state-transition-properties">previous article</a>, you saw how to get started with Property-Based Testing, using a Test-Driven Development tactic. In this article, you'll see the previous Tennis Kata example continued. This time, you'll see how to express properties for the state when one of the players have the advantage.
	</p>

		When one of the players have the advantage in tennis, the result can go one of two ways: either the player with the advantage wins the ball, in which case he or she wins the game, or the other player wins, in which case the next score is <em>deuce</em>. This implies that you'll have to write at least two properties: one for each situation. Let's start with the case where the advantaged player wins the ball. Using FsCheck, you can express that property like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>[&lt;<span style="color:#4ec9b0;">Property</span>&gt;]
<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">``Given&nbsp;advantage&nbsp;when&nbsp;advantaged&nbsp;player&nbsp;wins&nbsp;then&nbsp;score&nbsp;is&nbsp;correct``</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(advantagedPlayer&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:#4ec9b0;">Player</span>)&nbsp;=
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;actual&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:#4ec9b0;">Score</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">scoreWhenAdvantage</span>&nbsp;advantagedPlayer&nbsp;advantagedPlayer
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;expected&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">Game</span>&nbsp;advantagedPlayer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expected&nbsp;=!&nbsp;actual</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		As explained in the previous article, <a href="http://fscheck.github.io/FsCheck">FsCheck</a> will interpret this function and discover that it'll need to generate arbitrary Player values for the <code>advantagedPlayer</code> argument. Because <a href="/2016/02/10/types-properties-software-designing-with-types">illegal states are unrepresentable</a>, you're guaranteed valid values.
	</p>
	<p>
		This property calls the <code>scoreWhenAdvantage</code> function (that doesn't yet exist), passing <code>advantagedPlayer</code> as argument twice. The first argument is an indication of the current score. The scoreWhenAdvantage function only models how to transition out of the Advantage case. The data associated with the Advantage case is the player currently having the advantage, so passing in advantagedPlayer as the first argument describes the current state to the function.
	</p>
	<p>
		The second argument is the winner of the ball. In this test case, the same player wins again, so advantagedPlayer is passed as the second argument as well. The exact value of advantagedPlayer doesn't matter; this property holds for all (two) players.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <code>=!</code> operator is a custom operator defined by <a href="http://www.swensensoftware.com/unquote">Unquote</a>, an assertion library. You can read the expression as <em>expected must equal actual</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to pass this property, you can implement the function in the simplest way that could possibly work:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">scoreWhenAdvantage</span>&nbsp;advantagedPlayer&nbsp;winner&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">Game</span>&nbsp;advantagedPlayer
</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Here, I've arbitrarily chosen to return <code>Game advantagedPlayer</code>, but as an alternative, <code>Game winner</code> also passes the test.
	</p>
	<h3 id="ced50fef87864f3abd0d0c07849f24d1">
		Back to deuce <a href="#ced50fef87864f3abd0d0c07849f24d1" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		The above implementation of scoreWhenAdvantage is obviously incorrect, because it always claims that the advantaged player wins the game, regardless of who wins the ball. You'll need to describe the other test case as well, which is slightly more involved, yet still easy:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>[&lt;<span style="color:#4ec9b0;">Property</span>&gt;]
<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">``Given&nbsp;advantage&nbsp;when&nbsp;other&nbsp;player&nbsp;wins&nbsp;then&nbsp;score&nbsp;is&nbsp;correct``</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(advantagedPlayer&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:#4ec9b0;">Player</span>)&nbsp;=
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;actual&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">scoreWhenAdvantage</span>&nbsp;advantagedPlayer&nbsp;(<span style="color:navy;">other</span>&nbsp;advantagedPlayer)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">Deuce</span>&nbsp;=!&nbsp;actual</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The first argument to the scoreWhenAdvantage function describes the current score. The test case is that the other player wins the ball. In order to figure out who the other player is, you can call the <code>other</code> function.
	</p>
	<p>
		Which <code>other</code> function?
	</p>
	<p>
		The function you only now create for this express purpose:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">other</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">function</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">PlayerOne</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">PlayerTwo</span>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">PlayerTwo</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">PlayerOne</span>
</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		As the name suggests, this function returns the other player, for any given player. In the previous article, I promised to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming">point-free style</a>, but here I broke that promise. This function is equivalent to this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">other</span>&nbsp;player&nbsp;=&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">match</span>&nbsp;player&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">with</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">PlayerOne</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">PlayerTwo</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">PlayerTwo</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">PlayerOne</span></pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		I decided to place this function in the same module as the scoreWhenGame function, because it seemed like a generally useful function, more than a test-specific function. It turns out that the tennis score module, indeed, does need this function later.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since the <code>other</code> function is part of the module being tested, shouldn't you test it as well? For now, I'll leave it uncovered by directed tests, because it's so simple that I'm confident that it works, just by looking at it. Later, I can <a href="/2016/02/19/types-properties-software-other-properties">return to it in order to add some properties</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the <code>other</code> function in place, the new property fails, so you need to change the implementation of scoreWhenAdvantage in order to pass all tests:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">scoreWhenAdvantage</span>&nbsp;advantagedPlayer&nbsp;winner&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">if</span>&nbsp;advantagedPlayer&nbsp;=&nbsp;winner
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">then</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">Game</span>&nbsp;winner
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">else</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">Deuce</span></pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This implementation deals with all combinations of input.
	</p>
	<p>
		It turned out that, in this case, two properties are all we need in order to describe which tennis score comes after <em>advantage</em>.
	</p>

	<p>
		In this article, you saw how to express the properties associated with the <em>advantage</em> state of a tennis game. These properties were each simple. You can express each of them based on any arbitrary input of the given type, as shown here.
	</p>
	<p>
		Even when all test input values are guaranteed to be valid, sometimes you need to manipulate an arbitrary test value in order to describe a particular test case. You'll see how to do this in <a href="/2016/02/15/types-properties-software-properties-for-the-forties">the next article</a>.
