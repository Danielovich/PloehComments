    Perhaps you already know all about unit testing. Perhaps you already know all about F#. But do you know how to write unit tests in F#?

    <a href="{{ site.production_url }}/unit-testing-with-fsharp">My new Pluralsight course</a> explains how to write unit tests with F#. If you already know F# and unit testing on .NET, it's quite straightforward. This is my first <em>beginner</em>-level course on Pluralsight, so regular readers of this blog may find it too basic.

    Still, if you don't know what <a href="http://www.swensensoftware.com/unquote">Unquote</a> is and can do for you, you may want to consider watching module four, which introduces this great assertion library, and provides many examples.
  </p>
  <p>
    This entire course will, together with some of <a href="{{ site.production_url }}/pluralsight-courses">my existing Pluralsight courses</a>, serve as a basis for more courses on F# and Test-Driven Development.
