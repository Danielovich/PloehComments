title: "Null has no type, but Maybe has"
description: "In C#, null has no type, but most variables can be null; you can't really trust the type system. A Maybe, on the other hand, always has a type, which means that Maybe is a saner approach to the question of values that may or may not be present."

	</p>
	<p>
		A few days ago, I was looking at some C# code that, reduced to essentials, looked like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">string</span>&nbsp;foo&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">null</span>;<br/><span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;isNullAString&nbsp;=&nbsp;foo&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">is</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">string</span>;</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		What is the value of <code>isNullAString</code> after execution?
	</p>
	<p>
		Since <code>foo</code> is declared as a string, I thought that the answer clearly had to be <code>true</code>. Much to my surprise, it turns out that it's <code>false</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Wondering if I was exceptionally bad at predicting the type of null values, <a href="https://twitter.com/ploeh/status/663981498144526337">I created a Twitter poll</a>. 235 votes later, the outcome was this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="/content/binary/poll-results-for-is-a-null-string-a-string.png" alt="Poll results showing that 44% thought that the answer is true, and 56% thought that the answer is false.">
	</p>
	<p>
		Forty-four percent of respondents (some 103 people) were as wrong as I was! At one point, while the poll was still open and some 100 people had responded, the distribution was even fifty-fifty. Ultimately, I believe that the final results are artificially skewed toward <code>false</code>, because people could try the code first, before answering, and there's <a href="https://twitter.com/mishochu/status/664127000890609664">evidence that at least one person did that</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In short, that a null string isn't a string doesn't make much sense to a lot of people.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's not a bug, though. It's explicitly stated in section 7.10.10 of the C# language specification:
		<blockquote>
			"If E is [...] the null literal, of if the type of E is a reference type or a nullable type and the value of E is null, the result is false."
		</blockquote>
		The specification doesn't offer much of an explanation, but Eric Lippert shares <a href="http://ericlippert.com/2013/07/25/what-is-the-type-of-the-null-literal">some information on the topic</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		It still doesn't make any <em>sense</em> to me...
	</p>
	<p>
		Apparently, the rules of C#'s type system is: <em>a variable is guaranteed to be of a certain type, except when it isn't</em>. Once again, <code>null</code> throws a wrench into any attempt to reason sanely about code.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=1170">The .NET Rocks! episode</a> about <a href="/2015/04/13/less-is-more-language-features">less is more</a> sparked a ton of comments; most of them in defence of <code>null</code>. People don't seem to understand just how malicious null references are. That null has no type is yet another example.
	</p>
	<p>
		I think that the main reason that people defend null is that they have a hard time imagining other ways of modelling situations where a value may or may not be present. Even when introduced to the Maybe monad, most people remain unconvinced, because it's difficult to understand how Maybe is better than null.
	</p>
	<p>
		The difference is clear: only values explicitly declared as Maybes can be Maybes, and Maybe values <em>always have a type!</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		In F#, Maybe is called <code>option</code>, and it's always typed. The logical equivalent of the above type check would be this in F#:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;foo&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">string</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">option</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;None<br/><span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;isNoneAStringOption&nbsp;=&nbsp;foo&nbsp;:?&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">string</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">option</span></pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Only, this doesn't even compile!
	</p>
	<p>
		If you try this in F#, the compiler will complain:
		<blockquote>
			"error FS0016: The type 'string option' does not have any proper subtypes and cannot be used as the source of a type test or runtime coercion."
		</blockquote>
		That expression doesn't even make sense in F#. Of course <code>foo</code> is a <code>string option</code>, because it's the only thing it can be!
	</p>
	<p>
		You'll have to upcast <code>foo</code> to <code>obj</code> in order to be able to perform the type check:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;foo&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">string</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">option</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;None<br/><span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;isNoneAStringOption&nbsp;=&nbsp;box&nbsp;foo&nbsp;:?&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">string</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">option</span></pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		As expected, this evaluates to <code>true</code>. Of course <code>isNoneAStringOption</code> is <code>true</code>, even when it's <code>None</code>! What else could it possibly be?
	</p>
	<p>
		In Haskell, it doesn't even make sense to ask such a question, because there's no type hierarchy. In Haskell, you can't upcast a value to its base type, because there's no inheritance.
	</p>
	<p>
		In short, null values invalidate all rules and guarantees that the C# type system attempts to make. It's truly a toxic language 'feature'.

			<p><code>null</code> certainly is a toxic feature of C#. It was one of the key reasons behind me creating the <a href="https://github.com/DavidArno/SuccincT">Succinc&lt;T&gt; library</a>. It brings all the wonderfulness of F#'s options to C#.
			It let's one write equivalent code to your example:</p>
			<p><pre>var foo = Option&lt;string&gt;.None();<br/>var isNoneAStringOption = foo is Option&lt;string&gt;;</pre></p>
			<p>Which gives the same <code>true</code> result as the F# code.</p>
			<p>Just because a language has a feature, doesn't mean we have to use it. The same applies just as much to <code>null</code> as to <code>switch</code> and <code>goto</code>. Alternatives exist to these features.</p>
