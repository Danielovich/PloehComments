    A common criticism against Test-Driven Development (TDD) is that it <a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/test-induced-design-damage.html">leads to <em>Test-Induced Damage</em></a>. However, it doesn't have to be that way, and it turns out that with Functional Programming (FP), the design ideals of FP coincide with TDD.

     In my new Pluralsight course on <a href="{{ site.production_url }}/tdd-with-fsharp">Test-Driven Development with F#</a>, you'll learn how the intersection between TDD and F# presents opportunities for better design and better testability.
