		This article is part of <a href="/2018/01/08/software-design-isomorphisms">a series of articles about software design isomorphisms</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Many programming languages, such as C# and Java, distinguish between methods that return something, and methods that don't return anything. In C# and Java, a method must be declared with a return type, but if it doesn't return anything, you can use the special keyword <code>void</code> to indicate that this is the case:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">void</span>&nbsp;Foo(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;bar)</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This is a C# example, but it would look similar (isomorphic?) in Java.
	</p>

		Two kinds of methods <a href="#ed0cfa4cffe640fb91d0ee6eb8513408" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		In C# and Java, <code>void</code> isn't a type, but a keyword. This means that there are two distinct types of methods:
		<ul>
			<li>Methods that return something</li>
			<li>Methods that return nothing</li>
		</ul>
		In C#, methods that return something declare their return type before the method name:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Foo</span>&nbsp;Bar(<span style="color:#2b91af;">Baz</span>&nbsp;baz,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Qux</span>&nbsp;qux)</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		On the other hand, methods that return nothing must use the special <code>void</code> keyword:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">void</span>&nbsp;Bar(<span style="color:#2b91af;">Baz</span>&nbsp;baz,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Qux</span>&nbsp;qux)</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you want to generalise, you can use generics like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&nbsp;Foo&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T1</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T2</span>&gt;(<span style="color:#2b91af;">T1</span>&nbsp;x,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T2</span>&nbsp;y)</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Such a method could return <em>anything</em>, but, surprisingly, not <em>nothing</em>. In C# and Java, <em>nothing</em> is special. You can't generalise all methods to a common set. Even with generics, you must model methods that return nothing in a different way:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">void</span>&nbsp;Foo&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T1</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T2</span>&gt;(<span style="color:#2b91af;">T1</span>&nbsp;x,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T2</span>&nbsp;y)</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		In C#, for example, this leads to the distinction between <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb549151">Func</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/018hxwa8">Action</a>. You can't reconcile these two fundamentally distinct types of methods into one.
	</p>
	<p>
		Visual Basic .NET makes the same distinction, but uses the keywords <code>Sub</code> and <code>Function</code> instead of <code>void</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sometimes, particularly when writing code with generics, this dichotomy is really annoying. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to generalise all methods?

		Unit <a href="#f2edc83a82bb40bbaf52c5e313b54770" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		While I don't recall the source, I've read somewhere the suggestion that the keyword <code>void</code> was chosen to go with <code>null</code>, because <em>null and void</em> is an English (legal) idiom. That choice is, however, unfortunate.
	</p>
	<p>
		In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">category theory</a>, the term <em>void</em> denotes a type or set with <em>no</em> inhabitants (e.g. an empty set). That sounds like the same concept. The problem, from a programming perspective, is that if you have a (static) type with no inhabitants, you can't create an instance of it. See <a href="https://bartoszmilewski.com">Bartosz Milewski</a>'s article <a href="https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/11/24/types-and-functions">Types and Functions</a> for a great explanation and more details.
	</p>
	<p>
		Functional programming languages like <a href="http://fsharp.org">F#</a> and <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> instead model <em>nothing</em> by a type called <em>unit</em> (often rendered as empty brackets: <code>()</code>). This type is a type with exactly one inhabitant, a bit like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">Singleton</a>, but with the extra restriction that the inhabitant carries no information. It simply is.
	</p>
	<p>
		It may sound strange and counter-intuitive that a singleton value represents <em>nothing</em>, but it turns out that this is, indeed, isomorphic to C# or Java's <code>void</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is admirably illustrated by F#, which consistently uses <code>unit</code> instead of <code>void</code>. F# is a multi-paradigmatic language, so you can write classes with methods as well as functions:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">member</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#9d9d9d;">this</span>.<span style="color:navy;">Bar</span>&nbsp;(<span style="color:#9d9d9d;">x</span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:teal;">int</span>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;()</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This <code>Bar</code> method has the return type <code>unit</code>. When you compile F# code, it becomes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language">Intermediate Language</a>, which you can decompile into C#. If you do that, the above F# code becomes:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">void</span>&nbsp;Bar(<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;x)</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The inverse translation works as well. When you use F#'s interoperability features to interact with objects written in C# or Visual Basic, the F# compiler interprets <code>void</code> methods as if they return <code>unit</code>. For example, calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y46kxc5e">GC.Collect</a> returns <code>unit</code> in F#, although C# sees it as 'returning' <code>void</code>:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; GC.Collect 0;;
val it : unit = ()</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		F#'s <code>unit</code> is isomorphic to C#'s <code>void</code> keyword, but apart from that, there's nothing special about it. It's a value like any other, and can be used in generically typed functions, like the built-in <code>id</code> function:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; id 42;;
val it : int = 42

&gt; id "foo";;
val it : string = "foo"

&gt; id ();;
val it : unit = ()</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The built-in function <code>id</code> simply returns its input argument. It has the type <code>'a -&gt; 'a</code>, and as the above F# Interactive session demonstrates, you can call it with <code>unit</code> as well as with <code>int</code>, <code>string</code>, and so on.
	</p>
	<h3 id="4657dbd4b5fc4abda6e8dee2cac67ea9">
		Monoid <a href="#4657dbd4b5fc4abda6e8dee2cac67ea9" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Unit, by the way, forms a <a href="/2017/10/06/monoids">monoid</a>. This is most evident in Haskell, where this is encoded into the type. In general, a monoid is a binary operation, and not a type, but what could the combination of two <code>()</code> (unit) values be, other than <code>()</code>?
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>λ&gt; mempty :: ()
()

λ&gt; mappend () ()
()</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		In fact, the above (rhetorical) question is imprecise, since there aren't <em>two</em> unit values. There's only one, but used twice.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since only a single <em>unit</em> value exists, any binary operation is automatically associative, because, after all, it can only return <em>unit</em>. Likewise, <em>unit</em> is the identity (<code>mempty</code>) for the operation, because it doesn't change the output. Thus, the monoid laws hold, and <em>unit</em> forms a monoid.
	</p>
	<p>
		This result is interesting when you start to think about composition, because a monoid can always be used to reduce (aggregate) multiple values to a single value. With this result, and unit isomorphism, we've already explained why <a href="/2011/03/22/CommandsareComposable">Commands are composable</a>.

		Summary <a href="#8677103c217347c6b40cec336a581aff" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Since <em>unit</em> is a type only inhabited by a single value, people (including me) often use the word <em>unit</em> about both the type and its only value. Normally, the context surrounding such use is enough to dispel any ambiguity.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Unit</em> is isomorphic to C# or Java <code>void</code>. This is an important result, because if we're to study software design and code structure, we don't have to deal with two distinct cases (methods that return nothing, and methods that return something). Instead, we can ignore methods that return nothing, because they can instead be modelled as methods that return <em>unit</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The reason I've titled this article in the plural is that you could view the isomorphism between F# <code>unit</code> and C# <code>void</code> as a different isomorphism than the one between C# and Java <code>void</code>. Add Haskell's <code>()</code> (unit) type and Visual Basic's <code>Sub</code> keyword to the mix, and it should be clear that there are many translations to the category theory concept of <em>Unit</em>.

	<p>
		Unit isomorphism is an example of an interlingual isomorphism, in the sense that C# <code>void</code> maps to F# <code>unit</code>, and vice versa. In the next example, you'll see an isomorphism that mostly stays within a single language, although a translation between languages is also pertinent.
