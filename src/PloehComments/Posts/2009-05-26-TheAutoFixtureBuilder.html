    Until now, I've shown you how you can make wholesale adjustments or customizations to an entire Fixture instance, effectively changing the way it creates all instances of a particular type.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some scenarios, you'd rather want to customize how a single instance is created without influencing other instances of the same type. For this purpose, <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a> includes a class called ObjectBuilder&lt;T&gt; that can be used to do exactly that.
  </p>
  <p>
    The easiest way to get an instance of this class is by calling Build on a Fixture instance. This will give you an instance of ObjectBuilder&lt;T&gt; that you can use to customize the build steps. When you are done, CreateAnonymous returns the built instance.
  </p>
  <p>
  	<pre><span style="color: blue">var</span> mc = fixture.Build&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">MyClass</span>&gt;().CreateAnonymous();</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    This particular example doesn't define any customizations, so it's equivalent to
  </p>
  <p>
  	<pre><span style="color: blue">var</span> mc = fixture.CreateAnonymous&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">MyClass</span>&gt;();</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    In fact, Fixture.CreateAnonymous is little more than a convenience method wrapping an ObjectBuilder (there's a few extra differences, but that's a topic for another post).
  </p>
  <p>
    It's worth noting that the object specified by the type parameter to the Build method is first created when you call CreateAnonymous.
  </p>
  <p>
    In future posts I'll demonstrate how to use the Build method to customize individual <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ploeh/archive/2008/11/17/anonymous-variables.aspx">anonymous variables</a>.
