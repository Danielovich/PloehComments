		This article is the sixth in <a href="/2016/02/10/types-properties-software">a series of articles that demonstrate how to develop software using types and properties</a>. In the <a href="/2016/02/16/types-properties-software-composition">previous article</a>, you saw how to compose a function that returns a new score based on a previous score, and information about which player won the ball. In this article, you'll see how to define the initial state of a tennis game.

	<p>
		The source code for this article series is <a href="https://github.com/ploeh/KataTennis">available on GitHub</a>.

		You may recall from <a href="/2016/02/10/types-properties-software-designing-with-types">the article on designing with types</a> that a Score is a discriminated union. One of the union cases is the Points case, which you can use to model the case where both players have either Love, Fifteen, or Thirty points.
	</p>
	<p>
		The game starts with both players at love. You can define this as a value:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;newGame&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">Points</span>&nbsp;{&nbsp;PlayerOnePoint&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">Love</span>;&nbsp;PlayerTwoPoint&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">Love</span>&nbsp;}
</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Since this is a value (that is: not a function), it would make no sense to attempt to test it. Thus, you can simply add it, and move on.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can use this value to calculate ad-hoc scores from the beginning of a game, like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; let firstBall = score newGame PlayerTwo;;
val firstBall : Score = Points {PlayerOnePoint = Love;
                                PlayerTwoPoint = Fifteen;}

&gt; let secondBall = score firstBall PlayerOne;;
val secondBall : Score = Points {PlayerOnePoint = Fifteen;
                                 PlayerTwoPoint = Fifteen;}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		You'll soon get tired of defining <code>firstBall</code>, <code>secondBall</code>, <code>thirdBall</code>, and so on, so a more general way to handle and calculate scores is warranted.

		In this article, you saw how to define the initial state for a tennis game. There's nothing to it, but armed with this value, you now have half of the requirements needed to turn the tennis score function into a finite state machine. You'll see how to do that <a href="/2016/02/18/types-properties-software-finite-state-machine">in the next article</a>.
